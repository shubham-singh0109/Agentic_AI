Title,Date,Rating,Review
Best pizza in town,2024-03-15,5,"The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Their signature pepperoni pizza had the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, and the pepperoni curled up into little cups of deliciousness. Will definitely be back!"
Disappointed with service,2024-02-20,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."
Authentic Italian experience,2024-01-05,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
Overpriced for what you get,2024-03-01,3,"$24 for a medium pizza with just two toppings seems excessive. The ingredients were fresh and the crust was good, but nothing justified the premium price. There are better values elsewhere in town."
Great gluten-free option,2024-02-15,4,"As someone with celiac disease, finding good gluten-free pizza is a challenge. Their cauliflower crust was one of the best I've had - doesn't fall apart and has a nice flavor. Toppings were generous too."
Family night favorite,2024-03-10,5,"We bring our kids here every Friday night. The staff always make them feel special, providing dough for them to play with while we wait. Their kid-sized pizzas are perfect, and the parents love the craft beer selection."
Greasy and disappointing,2024-01-25,2,"I had high hopes based on the reviews, but my pizza was swimming in grease. The crust was undercooked in the center, and the promised 'fresh vegetables' looked and tasted canned. Such a letdown."
Hidden gem for vegans,2024-02-28,5,"I can't believe how good their vegan pizza is! They make their own cashew cheese that actually melts properly, and their vegetable toppings are always fresh and seasonal. Even my non-vegan friends love it."
Mediocre at best,2024-03-05,3,"Nothing terrible but nothing special either. The crust was okay, toppings were standard, and service was fine. It's the kind of place you go when you're in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip for."
Late night savior,2024-01-15,4,"Open until 2am on weekends, this place has saved me many times after a night out. Their slices are huge, reheated perfectly crisp, and they have creative toppings that hit the spot when you're hungry late at night."
Spicy special was too much,2024-02-10,2,Their 'Firebreather' pizza should come with a warning label. It wasn't enjoyably spicy - it was painfully hot to the point where I couldn't taste anything else. Had to throw most of it away.
Perfect thin crust,2024-03-18,5,"If you're a thin crust fan, this is your place. Cracker-thin, crispy all the way through, yet somehow still has a nice chew. Their simple cheese pizza showcases their excellent sauce - slightly sweet with a nice herb blend."
Dirty restaurant,2024-01-20,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."
Best Hawaiian in the city,2024-02-25,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."
Too much sauce,2024-03-08,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Amazing Detroit-style,2024-01-10,5,"Their Detroit-style square pizza is incredible - crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior, and those corner pieces are to die for! The pepperoni cup and char perfectly. Worth the 30-minute wait."
Inconsistent quality,2024-02-08,3,I've been here three times. First visit: amazing. Second: terrible. Third: just okay. Seems like it really depends on who's working that day. Wish they could maintain better quality control.
Perfect for lunch specials,2024-03-12,4,"Their lunch deal is unbeatable - $10 for a 10-inch pizza and small salad. The pizza comes out quickly, is always fresh, and the perfect size for one person. Great place for a work lunch."
Too noisy for conversation,2024-01-30,3,The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option.
Best white pizza ever,2024-02-18,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"
New owners ruined it,2024-03-03,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."
Creative seasonal specials,2024-01-12,5,"Just had their spring special with asparagus, lemon ricotta, and prosciutto. The combination was bright, fresh, and perfect for the season. Love that they use local, seasonal ingredients."
Epic meat lovers option,2024-02-22,4,"If you're a carnivore, their 'Butcher's Block' pizza is incredible. Five different meats, all high quality - the soppressata and house-made sausage are standouts. Just be ready for a food coma afterward!"
Burnt crust ruins it,2024-03-07,2,"They claim 'char' is part of the Neapolitan experience, but there's a difference between char and burnt. The entire bottom of my pizza was black and bitter. Scraping it off meant losing half the crust."
Perfect for big groups,2024-01-23,5,"We had a party of 12 and they accommodated us perfectly. Their 20-inch shareable pizzas are great for groups, and they were happy to do half-and-half toppings to please everyone. Service was impressively coordinated."
Undercooked in the middle,2024-02-12,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."
Phenomenal crust,2024-03-20,5,"Whatever they do to their dough is magical - it's got that perfect combination of crispy and chewy with a slight sourdough tang. I could eat their plain crust by itself, it's that good."
Skimpy on toppings,2024-01-18,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."
Excellent beer pairing suggestions,2024-02-27,5,"Not only is their pizza excellent (try the fig and prosciutto!), but the staff is knowledgeable about their craft beer selection and can suggest the perfect pairing for whatever pizza you order."
Too salty,2024-03-02,2,"Everything I tried was oversalted - the crust, the sauce, and especially the cheese. It was like they were trying to ensure you'd order more drinks. Couldn't finish my pizza and was thirsty all night."
Perfect NY-style slices,2024-01-08,5,"As a transplant from NYC, I've been searching for authentic NY-style pizza. This place nails it - thin, foldable slices with the right amount of chew and grease. Their plain cheese slice is perfection."
Terrible delivery experience,2024-02-14,1,"Ordered for Valentine's Day and regretted it. Pizza took 2 hours to arrive, was cold, and had the wrong toppings. Called the restaurant and they seemed completely unconcerned. Never again."
Innovative toppings,2024-03-16,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."
Not enough cheese,2024-01-28,3,"The sauce and crust were good, but they're stingy with cheese. You could see the sauce through the sparse cheese layer, and what was there didn't have that stretchy pull you want from a good pizza."
Perfect crust-to-topping ratio,2024-02-05,5,"Some places overload toppings so the crust gets soggy, others are too sparse. This place gets it perfect - enough toppings to get some in every bite, but not so much that the structural integrity is compromised."
Rude staff ruined the meal,2024-03-11,2,"The pizza itself was decent, but the counter staff was incredibly rude - sighing when I asked questions about ingredients, rushing my order, and actually rolling their eyes when I requested extra napkins."
Excellent for takeout,2024-01-13,4,"Their pizza travels remarkably well. Even after a 20-minute drive home, the crust was still crispy and everything was at the perfect temperature. They have their packaging technique down to a science."
Too expensive for pizza,2024-02-19,3,"The pizza is good, I'll give them that. But $30 for a basic large cheese pizza is highway robbery. Add toppings and you're looking at $40-50. The quality doesn't justify these premium prices."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2024-03-04,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Tiny portion sizes,2024-01-26,2,"Their 'personal' pizza is the size of a CD. For $15, I expected something that would actually satisfy my hunger. Had to order a second one, turning a quick lunch into an expensive disappointment."
Excellent Chicago deep dish,2024-02-23,5,"Hard to find authentic Chicago-style pizza in this area, but they nail it. The buttery, flaky crust, the layering of cheese under the sauce, the chunky tomato topping - all perfect. Worth the 45-minute cook time."
Too greasy to enjoy,2024-03-09,2,"Had to literally blot my pizza with napkins, which came away completely saturated with grease. Whatever flavor might have been there was drowned in oil. Couldn't finish it as it was making me feel ill."
Perfect balance of flavors,2024-01-16,5,"Their 'Mediterranean' pizza has the perfect balance of flavors - the briny olives, tangy feta, fresh tomatoes, and herb-infused olive oil all complement each other without any one element overwhelming the others."
Bland sauce needs work,2024-02-09,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
Excellent customer service,2024-03-17,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
Doughy and undercooked,2024-01-21,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Perfectly crispy crust,2024-02-24,5,"However they achieve it, their crust has the perfect crispness all the way through - no soggy middle! Even the slices with lots of toppings maintain their structural integrity. Engineering marvel of pizza."
Way too much oregano,2024-03-06,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
Authentic coal-fired perfection,2024-01-03,5,Their coal-fired oven gives the pizza a distinctive char and smoky flavor that's impossible to replicate any other way. The slight bitterness of the charred spots perfectly balances the sweetness of the sauce.
Refrigerated dough taste,2024-02-16,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."
Perfect for picky eaters,2024-03-13,4,Their 'build your own quarter' option is genius - a large pizza divided into quadrants with different toppings. Perfect for our family where everyone wants something different. No more ordering multiple pizzas!
Sauce like ketchup,2024-01-27,2,"The sauce was suspiciously sweet and one-dimensional, reminiscent of ketchup rather than a proper pizza sauce. No evidence of herbs, garlic, or any complexity. Ruined what otherwise could have been a decent pizza."
Perfect pepperoni placement,2024-02-17,5,"As a pepperoni perfectionist, I appreciate that they space the pepperoni so every bite gets one full piece. No bare spots or clumped areas. Shows attention to detail that elevates the whole experience."
Not worth the wait,2024-03-14,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."
Crispy yet chewy perfection,2024-01-19,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."
Too much cornmeal,2024-02-13,3,"They use cornmeal on the bottom of the crust to prevent sticking, which is standard, but they use so much that it's like eating pizza on a sandpaper surface. Gritty texture overwhelms the experience."
Incredible vodka sauce base,2024-03-19,5,"Their vodka sauce pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil is something special. The creamy, slightly spicy sauce is a perfect alternative to traditional tomato sauce. Add prosciutto for an extra flavor dimension!"
Cold center burnt edges,2024-01-22,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2024-02-26,5,They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!
Weird aftertaste,2024-03-01,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."
Outstanding variety of options,2024-01-07,5,"Their menu has something for everyone - traditional options done well, creative specialties, and customizable choices. Even have dessert pizzas that are surprisingly good (try the Nutella and banana!)."
All style no substance,2024-02-21,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."
Perfect temperature every time,2024-03-15,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
Stale-tasting crust,2024-01-29,2,"The crust had a stale, almost cardboard-like quality that suggests either old dough or old flour. Fresh ingredients on top couldn't compensate for the foundation being off."
Excellent wine pairings,2024-02-07,5,"Their curated wine list is designed specifically to pair with their pizzas, and the staff is knowledgeable about suggesting the perfect match. The house red with their sausage pizza is a transcendent combination."
Too much garlic,2024-03-08,3,"I love garlic but this was excessive - felt like they mistook cloves for teaspoons in the recipe. My breath was lethal afterward, and the powerful flavor overwhelmed the other ingredients."
Perfect for kids' parties,2024-01-11,5,"Hosted my son's birthday here and it was fantastic. They did a dough-tossing demonstration for the kids, let them make their own mini pizzas, and the staff was incredibly patient and kind."
Toppings slide right off,2024-02-11,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Expert-level pizza folding,2024-03-10,5,Their thin-crust slices fold perfectly New York-style without cracking or losing toppings. The slight resistance before the fold is exactly what you want - showing the perfect balance of crisp and chew.
No flavor distinction,2024-01-17,3,Ordered two completely different specialty pizzas but they somehow tasted nearly identical. It's like they use the same base for everything and the toppings don't impart enough distinctive character.
Righteous ranch drizzle,2024-02-03,5,Their house-made ranch drizzle takes their pizzas to another level. It's not your typical ranch - has hints of dill and garlic with a perfect consistency that adds creaminess without making things soggy.
Too much cheese,2024-03-04,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Perfect crunch factor,2024-01-24,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."
Burned mouth on first bite,2024-02-20,2,"They served the pizza dangerously hot - barely out of the oven with no time to cool. Severely burned the roof of my mouth on the first bite, which ruined the rest of the meal and my next few days."
Superior ingredients make the difference,2024-03-18,5,"They import their flour from Italy, use San Marzano tomatoes, and make their mozzarella in-house daily. The commitment to quality ingredients is evident in every bite - nothing is an afterthought."
Underwhelming and basic,2024-01-09,3,"Nothing particularly wrong with it, but nothing memorable either. Standard crust, standard sauce, standard toppings. In a city with so many pizza options, this place doesn't give you any reason to return."
Excellent attention to cooking time,2024-02-22,5,They nail the cooking time perfectly - pulling the pizza from the oven at exactly the right moment when the cheese is fully melted and bubbling but not yet browned. Shows expertise and attention to detail.
False advertising on size,2024-03-12,2,"Their menu clearly states that a large pizza is 16 inches, but what we received couldn't have been more than 14 inches. When questioned, they claimed their menu was outdated but refused any adjustment."
Perfect ingredient distribution,2024-01-06,5,"Every bite had the perfect combination of ingredients - no barren spots, no overwhelming clumps. The toppings were distributed with such precision it almost seemed measured. The mark of true professionals!"
Lackluster veggie options,2024-02-19,3,"Their vegetable toppings lacked freshness and flavor - the mushrooms were clearly canned, the peppers were soft and faded, and the onions were sparse. Disappointing for a place that advertises farm-fresh ingredients."
Ideal char-to-chew ratio,2024-03-03,5,The small charred bubbles on the crust add amazing flavor without dominating. They've mastered that balance between the slight bitterness of char and the natural sweetness of the dough. Technical perfection!
Cheese solidified too quickly,2024-01-31,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2024-02-15,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
No-cheese option was all sauce,2024-03-11,2,"Ordered a cheese-free pizza for my dairy-allergic friend, but they made no adjustments - just removed the cheese and left a soggy sauce-covered bread. Good pizza without cheese requires rebalancing other elements."
Outstanding breakfast pizza,2024-01-14,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
Painfully obvious cheap ingredients,2024-02-08,2,"The pre-shredded cheese didn't melt properly, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the sausage had that distinctive processed flavor. At these prices, cutting corners on ingredients is inexcusable."
Perfect for late-night cravings,2024-03-07,5,"Open until 3am on weekends, this place has saved many late nights. The slices are huge, they reheat them perfectly so they're crispy, and their special late-night menu items are creative and delicious."
Too thin to be satisfying,2024-01-25,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Masterful use of olive oil,2024-02-28,5,"The drizzle of high-quality olive oil they add just before serving makes all the difference - adds richness, enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, and adds a wonderful aromatic element. Simple but transformative."
Absurdly small slices,2024-03-05,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2024-01-02,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
Tough leathery crust,2024-02-04,2,"The crust was so tough I almost couldn't bite through it - like trying to eat leather. The edges were particularly problematic, had to tear pieces off with significant effort. Completely lacks the pleasant chewiness good pizza should have."
Exceptional spinach ricotta pie,2024-03-09,5,Their white pizza with spinach and ricotta is exceptional - the creamy richness of the cheese balanced by the slight bitterness of the greens. The garlic-infused olive oil base ties everything together perfectly.
Sloppy presentation,2024-01-13,3,"The pizza looked like it had been assembled in a hurry - toppings haphazardly thrown on, cheese unevenly distributed, and the cutting was so uneven that some slices were twice the size of others. Taste was okay, but appearance matters too."
Brilliant seasonal rotation,2024-02-23,5,"Love that they have a rotating seasonal pizza that showcases what's fresh. The current spring offering with asparagus, green garlic, and fresh peas is bright and delicious - a perfect reflection of the season."
Way too much crust,2024-03-16,2,The edge crust (cornicione) was comically large - almost half of each slice was just bread with no toppings. This ratio of crust to actual pizza was way off and made for a disappointing experience.
Perfect textural contrast,2024-01-18,5,"The contrast between the crisp bottom, the tender interior crumb, the gooey cheese, and the slight resistance of the toppings creates a textural symphony. Each bite is interesting and satisfying in a different way."
Unmelted cheese in the center,2024-02-06,2,"The edges were fine but the center had cold, unmelted cheese - a sign the oven wasn't hot enough or the pizza wasn't cooked long enough. Basic pizza fundamentals seem to be lacking."
Innovative flavor combinations,2024-03-13,5,"Their 'Avant Garde' menu section features combinations I would never have thought of but somehow work perfectly. The pear, gorgonzola, walnut, and honey pizza was a revelation of sweet, salty, and savory harmony."
Burned bottom raw top,2024-01-20,1,The bottom of the crust was completely black while the cheese on top wasn't fully melted. This temperature imbalance suggests serious issues with their oven management and pizza-making technique.
Perfect for watching sports,2024-02-27,4,"Great setup with TVs visible from every table, excellent pitcher specials during games, and their 'Game Day' pizza loaded with multiple meats and jalapeños is the perfect sports-watching food. Atmosphere gets lively but not obnoxious."
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2024-03-02,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Outstanding wood-fired perfection,2024-01-04,5,The wood-fired oven gives their pizza a distinctive smoky complexity you can't get any other way. The slight char adds bitterness that balances the sweetness of the sauce perfectly. Worth seeking out for this unique flavor profile.
Too much salt in the dough,2024-02-10,2,The crust was so salty it was almost inedible - overwhelmed all the other flavors and left me incredibly thirsty afterward. A heavy hand with salt ruined what could have been a good pizza.
Excellence in simplicity,2024-03-19,5,"Their classic Margherita showcases their commitment to quality - the balance of sweet-acidic tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella, fragrant basil, and that perfectly chewy-crisp crust. Proof that simple can be sublime."
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2024-01-30,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."
Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2024-02-25,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies. The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."
Pizza barely survived the drive home,2024-03-04,2,"Ordered takeout and by the time I got home (15 minutes), the pizza was a soggy mess. They clearly don't use appropriate packaging for takeout - no vents to release steam means the crust steams itself into sogginess."
Magnificent flavor layering,2024-01-15,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Crust like cardboard,2024-02-12,2,"The crust had all the flavor and texture of packing material - dry, tough, and completely devoid of character. Even the decent toppings couldn't save it. The foundation of good pizza is good dough, and this wasn't it."
Perfect for large parties,2024-03-14,5,"Their party package is fantastic - multiple 18-inch pizzas with varied toppings, plenty of sides, and they were accommodating with our group of 20. Everything arrived hot and on time, and they included all the necessary paper goods."
False advertising on ingredients,2024-01-08,1,"Menu promised 'house-made Italian sausage' but what came on my pizza was clearly pre-formed, uniform pellets of commercial sausage. When questioned, staff admitted they don't make any ingredients in-house despite menu claims."
Supreme quality control,2024-02-18,5,"Visited multiple times and the consistency is impressive - every pizza comes out identical to the last one, with the same excellent quality. Shows serious commitment to training and standards that's rare in casual dining."
Pizza arrived upside-down,2024-03-06,1,Delivery driver must have taken a sharp turn because our pizza arrived completely flipped over in the box - all toppings stuck to the lid. Restaurant offered no solution other than suggesting we 'scrape it off and reassemble it.'
Exceptional sauce-making technique,2024-01-26,5,"You can tell their sauce is made with properly hand-crushed tomatoes - it has that perfect texture with small chunks rather than being completely smooth. The bright flavor suggests minimal cooking, allowing the tomato quality to shine."
Too much emphasis on appearance,2024-02-14,3,"The pizza was clearly designed to look good in photos - perfect symmetry, vibrant colors, photogenic cheese pull - but the flavor was underwhelming. Style over substance for the Instagram crowd."
Brilliant use of fermented dough,2024-03-17,5,Their 72-hour fermented dough has incredible depth of flavor with subtle sourdough notes. The extended fermentation creates a complex web of flavors and perfect texture that you simply can't achieve with quick-rise methods.
Excessive grease pooling,2024-01-22,2,"Had to continuously blot the pizza with napkins as pools of orange grease formed on top of the cheese with every passing minute. By the end, the napkins were completely saturated and transparent. Felt unhealthy even by pizza standards."
Perfect for dietary restrictions,2024-02-09,5,"As someone with multiple food allergies, I appreciate that they take dietary concerns seriously. Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"
Tasteless cheese substitute,2024-03-01,2,"Their vegan cheese option was terrible - had no meltability, a grainy texture, and tasted strongly of coconut which clashed with the tomato sauce. If you can't do vegan cheese well, better to offer cheese-free options that are properly balanced."
Masterclass in proper baking,2024-01-10,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
Tomato sauce tasted rancid,2024-02-16,1,"The sauce had a distinctly off flavor that suggested the tomatoes had gone bad before processing. After two bites, couldn't continue eating as the rancid notes became more pronounced. Basic food safety seems questionable."
Perfect buffalo mozzarella application,2024-03-20,5,They understand that buffalo mozzarella shouldn't be cooked too long or it loses its distinctive texture and flavor. Applied in dollops after the pizza is mostly baked so it just barely melts while maintaining its creamy integrity. Technical perfection!
Undercooked in the middle,2023-11-11,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."
Overpriced for what you get,2024-03-14,3,"$24 for a medium pizza with just two toppings seems excessive. The ingredients were fresh and the crust was good, but nothing justified the premium price. There are better values elsewhere in town."
Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2025-01-18,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2023-10-01,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Way too much oregano,2023-08-23,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
Sauce like ketchup,2023-11-04,2,"The sauce was suspiciously sweet and one-dimensional, reminiscent of ketchup rather than a proper pizza sauce. No evidence of herbs, garlic, or any complexity. Ruined what otherwise could have been a decent pizza."
No-cheese option was all sauce,2023-01-31,2,"Ordered a cheese-free pizza for my dairy-allergic friend, but they made no adjustments - just removed the cheese and left a soggy sauce-covered bread. Good pizza without cheese requires rebalancing other elements."
Perfect for lunch specials,2025-06-27,4,"Their lunch deal is unbeatable - $10 for a 10-inch pizza and small salad. The pizza comes out quickly, is always fresh, and the perfect size for one person. Great place for a work lunch."
Tough leathery crust,2024-06-14,2,"The crust was so tough I almost couldn't bite through it - like trying to eat leather. The edges were particularly problematic, had to tear pieces off with significant effort. Completely lacks the pleasant chewiness good pizza should have."
Excellent for takeout,2025-05-15,4,"Their pizza travels remarkably well. Even after a 20-minute drive home, the crust was still crispy and everything was at the perfect temperature. They have their packaging technique down to a science."
Burned bottom raw top,2023-12-12,1,The bottom of the crust was completely black while the cheese on top wasn't fully melted. This temperature imbalance suggests serious issues with their oven management and pizza-making technique.
Authentic coal-fired perfection,2024-08-22,5,Their coal-fired oven gives the pizza a distinctive char and smoky flavor that's impossible to replicate any other way. The slight bitterness of the charred spots perfectly balances the sweetness of the sauce.
Innovative flavor combinations,2024-07-31,5,"Their 'Avant Garde' menu section features combinations I would never have thought of but somehow work perfectly. The pear, gorgonzola, walnut, and honey pizza was a revelation of sweet, salty, and savory harmony."
Family night favorite,2023-08-02,5,"We bring our kids here every Friday night. The staff always make them feel special, providing dough for them to play with while we wait. Their kid-sized pizzas are perfect, and the parents love the craft beer selection."
Brilliant seasonal rotation,2024-01-18,5,"Love that they have a rotating seasonal pizza that showcases what's fresh. The current spring offering with asparagus, green garlic, and fresh peas is bright and delicious - a perfect reflection of the season."
Excellent wine pairings,2024-12-04,5,"Their curated wine list is designed specifically to pair with their pizzas, and the staff is knowledgeable about suggesting the perfect match. The house red with their sausage pizza is a transcendent combination."
Too thin to be satisfying,2024-02-08,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Incredible vodka sauce base,2023-12-14,5,"Their vodka sauce pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil is something special. The creamy, slightly spicy sauce is a perfect alternative to traditional tomato sauce. Add prosciutto for an extra flavor dimension!"
Too thin to be satisfying,2024-11-09,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Masterful use of olive oil,2023-01-11,5,"The drizzle of high-quality olive oil they add just before serving makes all the difference - adds richness, enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, and adds a wonderful aromatic element. Simple but transformative."
Authentic Italian experience,2024-08-24,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
Great gluten-free option,2024-09-06,4,"As someone with celiac disease, finding good gluten-free pizza is a challenge. Their cauliflower crust was one of the best I've had - doesn't fall apart and has a nice flavor. Toppings were generous too."
Tough leathery crust,2025-04-22,2,"The crust was so tough I almost couldn't bite through it - like trying to eat leather. The edges were particularly problematic, had to tear pieces off with significant effort. Completely lacks the pleasant chewiness good pizza should have."
Tomato sauce tasted rancid,2024-06-12,1,"The sauce had a distinctly off flavor that suggested the tomatoes had gone bad before processing. After two bites, couldn't continue eating as the rancid notes became more pronounced. Basic food safety seems questionable."
Perfect for late-night cravings,2023-05-01,5,"Open until 3am on weekends, this place has saved many late nights. The slices are huge, they reheat them perfectly so they're crispy, and their special late-night menu items are creative and delicious."
Brilliant use of fermented dough,2023-02-21,5,Their 72-hour fermented dough has incredible depth of flavor with subtle sourdough notes. The extended fermentation creates a complex web of flavors and perfect texture that you simply can't achieve with quick-rise methods.
Creative seasonal specials,2023-04-28,5,"Just had their spring special with asparagus, lemon ricotta, and prosciutto. The combination was bright, fresh, and perfect for the season. Love that they use local, seasonal ingredients."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2023-12-20,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Best pizza in town,2024-12-27,5,"The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Their signature pepperoni pizza had the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, and the pepperoni curled up into little cups of deliciousness. Will definitely be back!"
Too much salt in the dough,2024-01-07,2,The crust was so salty it was almost inedible - overwhelmed all the other flavors and left me incredibly thirsty afterward. A heavy hand with salt ruined what could have been a good pizza.
Perfect ingredient distribution,2023-09-18,5,"Every bite had the perfect combination of ingredients - no barren spots, no overwhelming clumps. The toppings were distributed with such precision it almost seemed measured. The mark of true professionals!"
Outstanding variety of options,2024-12-03,5,"Their menu has something for everyone - traditional options done well, creative specialties, and customizable choices. Even have dessert pizzas that are surprisingly good (try the Nutella and banana!)."
Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2024-01-29,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
Perfect for dietary restrictions,2025-06-23,5,"As someone with multiple food allergies, I appreciate that they take dietary concerns seriously. Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"
Perfect ingredient distribution,2023-09-29,5,"Every bite had the perfect combination of ingredients - no barren spots, no overwhelming clumps. The toppings were distributed with such precision it almost seemed measured. The mark of true professionals!"
Phenomenal crust,2024-05-07,5,"Whatever they do to their dough is magical - it's got that perfect combination of crispy and chewy with a slight sourdough tang. I could eat their plain crust by itself, it's that good."
Excellent customer service,2024-07-25,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2023-05-16,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Inconsistent quality,2023-01-31,3,I've been here three times. First visit: amazing. Second: terrible. Third: just okay. Seems like it really depends on who's working that day. Wish they could maintain better quality control.
Excellent beer pairing suggestions,2023-12-25,5,"Not only is their pizza excellent (try the fig and prosciutto!), but the staff is knowledgeable about their craft beer selection and can suggest the perfect pairing for whatever pizza you order."
Toppings slide right off,2025-04-21,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Perfect ingredient distribution,2023-08-07,5,"Every bite had the perfect combination of ingredients - no barren spots, no overwhelming clumps. The toppings were distributed with such precision it almost seemed measured. The mark of true professionals!"
Underwhelming and basic,2023-03-15,3,"Nothing particularly wrong with it, but nothing memorable either. Standard crust, standard sauce, standard toppings. In a city with so many pizza options, this place doesn't give you any reason to return."
Exceptional sauce-making technique,2024-02-21,5,"You can tell their sauce is made with properly hand-crushed tomatoes - it has that perfect texture with small chunks rather than being completely smooth. The bright flavor suggests minimal cooking, allowing the tomato quality to shine."
Refrigerated dough taste,2024-03-18,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."
Superior ingredients make the difference,2023-06-23,5,"They import their flour from Italy, use San Marzano tomatoes, and make their mozzarella in-house daily. The commitment to quality ingredients is evident in every bite - nothing is an afterthought."
Authentic Italian experience,2024-03-15,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
Too thin to be satisfying,2024-10-16,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Perfect balance of flavors,2023-02-21,5,"Their 'Mediterranean' pizza has the perfect balance of flavors - the briny olives, tangy feta, fresh tomatoes, and herb-infused olive oil all complement each other without any one element overwhelming the others."
Tiny portion sizes,2023-07-18,2,"Their 'personal' pizza is the size of a CD. For $15, I expected something that would actually satisfy my hunger. Had to order a second one, turning a quick lunch into an expensive disappointment."
Burned mouth on first bite,2023-10-19,2,"They served the pizza dangerously hot - barely out of the oven with no time to cool. Severely burned the roof of my mouth on the first bite, which ruined the rest of the meal and my next few days."
Excellent wine pairings,2024-06-10,5,"Their curated wine list is designed specifically to pair with their pizzas, and the staff is knowledgeable about suggesting the perfect match. The house red with their sausage pizza is a transcendent combination."
Too noisy for conversation,2023-07-03,3,The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option.
False advertising on ingredients,2023-10-17,1,"Menu promised 'house-made Italian sausage' but what came on my pizza was clearly pre-formed, uniform pellets of commercial sausage. When questioned, staff admitted they don't make any ingredients in-house despite menu claims."
Perfectly crispy crust,2024-06-05,5,"However they achieve it, their crust has the perfect crispness all the way through - no soggy middle! Even the slices with lots of toppings maintain their structural integrity. Engineering marvel of pizza."
Perfect pepperoni placement,2024-01-12,5,"As a pepperoni perfectionist, I appreciate that they space the pepperoni so every bite gets one full piece. No bare spots or clumped areas. Shows attention to detail that elevates the whole experience."
Sauce like ketchup,2024-01-03,2,"The sauce was suspiciously sweet and one-dimensional, reminiscent of ketchup rather than a proper pizza sauce. No evidence of herbs, garlic, or any complexity. Ruined what otherwise could have been a decent pizza."
Excellence in simplicity,2024-05-15,5,"Their classic Margherita showcases their commitment to quality - the balance of sweet-acidic tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella, fragrant basil, and that perfectly chewy-crisp crust. Proof that simple can be sublime."
Best white pizza ever,2025-04-27,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"
Supreme quality control,2025-02-18,5,"Visited multiple times and the consistency is impressive - every pizza comes out identical to the last one, with the same excellent quality. Shows serious commitment to training and standards that's rare in casual dining."
Perfect textural contrast,2023-02-15,5,"The contrast between the crisp bottom, the tender interior crumb, the gooey cheese, and the slight resistance of the toppings creates a textural symphony. Each bite is interesting and satisfying in a different way."
No-cheese option was all sauce,2023-02-23,2,"Ordered a cheese-free pizza for my dairy-allergic friend, but they made no adjustments - just removed the cheese and left a soggy sauce-covered bread. Good pizza without cheese requires rebalancing other elements."
Too expensive for pizza,2023-12-04,3,"The pizza is good, I'll give them that. But $30 for a basic large cheese pizza is highway robbery. Add toppings and you're looking at $40-50. The quality doesn't justify these premium prices."
Excessive grease pooling,2024-11-21,2,"Had to continuously blot the pizza with napkins as pools of orange grease formed on top of the cheese with every passing minute. By the end, the napkins were completely saturated and transparent. Felt unhealthy even by pizza standards."
Authentic Italian experience,2024-06-21,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
Righteous ranch drizzle,2023-08-05,5,Their house-made ranch drizzle takes their pizzas to another level. It's not your typical ranch - has hints of dill and garlic with a perfect consistency that adds creaminess without making things soggy.
Hidden gem for vegans,2024-05-29,5,"I can't believe how good their vegan pizza is! They make their own cashew cheese that actually melts properly, and their vegetable toppings are always fresh and seasonal. Even my non-vegan friends love it."
Perfect thin crust,2023-06-05,5,"If you're a thin crust fan, this is your place. Cracker-thin, crispy all the way through, yet somehow still has a nice chew. Their simple cheese pizza showcases their excellent sauce - slightly sweet with a nice herb blend."
Family night favorite,2024-06-30,5,"We bring our kids here every Friday night. The staff always make them feel special, providing dough for them to play with while we wait. Their kid-sized pizzas are perfect, and the parents love the craft beer selection."
Excellent Chicago deep dish,2023-01-26,5,"Hard to find authentic Chicago-style pizza in this area, but they nail it. The buttery, flaky crust, the layering of cheese under the sauce, the chunky tomato topping - all perfect. Worth the 45-minute cook time."
Unmelted cheese in the center,2024-09-16,2,"The edges were fine but the center had cold, unmelted cheese - a sign the oven wasn't hot enough or the pizza wasn't cooked long enough. Basic pizza fundamentals seem to be lacking."
No-cheese option was all sauce,2023-09-24,2,"Ordered a cheese-free pizza for my dairy-allergic friend, but they made no adjustments - just removed the cheese and left a soggy sauce-covered bread. Good pizza without cheese requires rebalancing other elements."
Excellent customer service,2023-06-10,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
Too much salt in the dough,2025-06-14,2,The crust was so salty it was almost inedible - overwhelmed all the other flavors and left me incredibly thirsty afterward. A heavy hand with salt ruined what could have been a good pizza.
All style no substance,2023-08-08,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."
Tasteless cheese substitute,2023-02-22,2,"Their vegan cheese option was terrible - had no meltability, a grainy texture, and tasted strongly of coconut which clashed with the tomato sauce. If you can't do vegan cheese well, better to offer cheese-free options that are properly balanced."
Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2024-03-30,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
Perfect for picky eaters,2023-09-06,4,Their 'build your own quarter' option is genius - a large pizza divided into quadrants with different toppings. Perfect for our family where everyone wants something different. No more ordering multiple pizzas!
Perfect for big groups,2025-01-11,5,"We had a party of 12 and they accommodated us perfectly. Their 20-inch shareable pizzas are great for groups, and they were happy to do half-and-half toppings to please everyone. Service was impressively coordinated."
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2024-05-11,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Amazing Detroit-style,2023-01-07,5,"Their Detroit-style square pizza is incredible - crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior, and those corner pieces are to die for! The pepperoni cup and char perfectly. Worth the 30-minute wait."
Burnt crust ruins it,2024-05-11,2,"They claim 'char' is part of the Neapolitan experience, but there's a difference between char and burnt. The entire bottom of my pizza was black and bitter. Scraping it off meant losing half the crust."
Outstanding breakfast pizza,2023-12-04,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
Too greasy to enjoy,2025-04-12,2,"Had to literally blot my pizza with napkins, which came away completely saturated with grease. Whatever flavor might have been there was drowned in oil. Couldn't finish it as it was making me feel ill."
Authentic Italian experience,2023-09-18,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."

Excellent attention to cooking time,2023-07-30,5,They nail the cooking time perfectly - pulling the pizza from the oven at exactly the right moment when the cheese is fully melted and bubbling but not yet browned. Shows expertise and attention to detail.
Outstanding breakfast pizza,2024-12-24,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
Too much cheese,2023-03-02,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Too thin to be satisfying,2025-04-27,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Way too much crust,2023-01-11,2,The edge crust (cornicione) was comically large - almost half of each slice was just bread with no toppings. This ratio of crust to actual pizza was way off and made for a disappointing experience.
Authentic Italian experience,2024-08-17,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
Tomato sauce tasted rancid,2023-12-31,1,"The sauce had a distinctly off flavor that suggested the tomatoes had gone bad before processing. After two bites, couldn't continue eating as the rancid notes became more pronounced. Basic food safety seems questionable."
Crust like cardboard,2024-01-07,2,"The crust had all the flavor and texture of packing material - dry, tough, and completely devoid of character. Even the decent toppings couldn't save it. The foundation of good pizza is good dough, and this wasn't it."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2023-07-07,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
False advertising on size,2023-11-18,2,"Their menu clearly states that a large pizza is 16 inches, but what we received couldn't have been more than 14 inches. When questioned, they claimed their menu was outdated but refused any adjustment."
Innovative flavor combinations,2024-08-17,5,"Their 'Avant Garde' menu section features combinations I would never have thought of but somehow work perfectly. The pear, gorgonzola, walnut, and honey pizza was a revelation of sweet, salty, and savory harmony."
Perfect for kids' parties,2024-10-18,5,"Hosted my son's birthday here and it was fantastic. They did a dough-tossing demonstration for the kids, let them make their own mini pizzas, and the staff was incredibly patient and kind."
Perfect temperature every time,2024-11-14,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
Dirty restaurant,2023-09-11,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2023-12-01,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
No flavor distinction,2024-02-08,3,Ordered two completely different specialty pizzas but they somehow tasted nearly identical. It's like they use the same base for everything and the toppings don't impart enough distinctive character.
Magnificent flavor layering,2024-04-26,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Perfect crunch factor,2025-06-21,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."
Not worth the wait,2025-04-29,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."
False advertising on ingredients,2025-02-10,1,"Menu promised 'house-made Italian sausage' but what came on my pizza was clearly pre-formed, uniform pellets of commercial sausage. When questioned, staff admitted they don't make any ingredients in-house despite menu claims."
Amazing Detroit-style,2024-06-03,5,"Their Detroit-style square pizza is incredible - crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior, and those corner pieces are to die for! The pepperoni cup and char perfectly. Worth the 30-minute wait."
Perfect buffalo mozzarella application,2024-11-08,5,They understand that buffalo mozzarella shouldn't be cooked too long or it loses its distinctive texture and flavor. Applied in dollops after the pizza is mostly baked so it just barely melts while maintaining its creamy integrity. Technical perfection!
Amazing Detroit-style,2024-06-03,5,"Their Detroit-style square pizza is incredible - crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior, and those corner pieces are to die for! The pepperoni cup and char perfectly. Worth the 30-minute wait."

Burnt crust ruins it,2024-05-16,2,"They claim 'char' is part of the Neapolitan experience, but there's a difference between char and burnt. The entire bottom of my pizza was black and bitter. Scraping it off meant losing half the crust."
Exceptional spinach ricotta pie,2023-11-12,5,Their white pizza with spinach and ricotta is exceptional - the creamy richness of the cheese balanced by the slight bitterness of the greens. The garlic-infused olive oil base ties everything together perfectly.
Crust like cardboard,2025-04-24,2,"The crust had all the flavor and texture of packing material - dry, tough, and completely devoid of character. Even the decent toppings couldn't save it. The foundation of good pizza is good dough, and this wasn't it."
Inconsistent quality,2025-06-12,3,I've been here three times. First visit: amazing. Second: terrible. Third: just okay. Seems like it really depends on who's working that day. Wish they could maintain better quality control.

Disappointed with service,2024-03-23,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."
Tomato sauce tasted rancid,2024-01-01,1,"The sauce had a distinctly off flavor that suggested the tomatoes had gone bad before processing. After two bites, couldn't continue eating as the rancid notes became more pronounced. Basic food safety seems questionable."
Excellent for takeout,2024-10-16,4,"Their pizza travels remarkably well. Even after a 20-minute drive home, the crust was still crispy and everything was at the perfect temperature. They have their packaging technique down to a science."
Outstanding variety of options,2025-06-29,5,"Their menu has something for everyone - traditional options done well, creative specialties, and customizable choices. Even have dessert pizzas that are surprisingly good (try the Nutella and banana!)."
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2025-02-20,5,They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!
Tough leathery crust,2025-02-09,2,"The crust was so tough I almost couldn't bite through it - like trying to eat leather. The edges were particularly problematic, had to tear pieces off with significant effort. Completely lacks the pleasant chewiness good pizza should have."
Not enough cheese,2025-06-29,3,"The sauce and crust were good, but they're stingy with cheese. You could see the sauce through the sparse cheese layer, and what was there didn't have that stretchy pull you want from a good pizza."
Great gluten-free option,2024-05-24,4,"As someone with celiac disease, finding good gluten-free pizza is a challenge. Their cauliflower crust was one of the best I've had - doesn't fall apart and has a nice flavor. Toppings were generous too."
Sloppy presentation,2024-07-02,3,"The pizza looked like it had been assembled in a hurry - toppings haphazardly thrown on, cheese unevenly distributed, and the cutting was so uneven that some slices were twice the size of others. Taste was okay, but appearance matters too."
Burned bottom raw top,2023-02-17,1,The bottom of the crust was completely black while the cheese on top wasn't fully melted. This temperature imbalance suggests serious issues with their oven management and pizza-making technique.
New owners ruined it,2024-12-25,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."
Burned mouth on first bite,2023-10-14,2,"They served the pizza dangerously hot - barely out of the oven with no time to cool. Severely burned the roof of my mouth on the first bite, which ruined the rest of the meal and my next few days."

Refrigerated dough taste,2023-02-08,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."
Excellent wine pairings,2025-06-07,5,"Their curated wine list is designed specifically to pair with their pizzas, and the staff is knowledgeable about suggesting the perfect match. The house red with their sausage pizza is a transcendent combination."

All style no substance,2024-03-20,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."
Best white pizza ever,2025-05-09,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"
Dirty restaurant,2023-01-19,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."

Perfect for lunch specials,2023-08-23,4,"Their lunch deal is unbeatable - $10 for a 10-inch pizza and small salad. The pizza comes out quickly, is always fresh, and the perfect size for one person. Great place for a work lunch."

Righteous ranch drizzle,2024-03-27,5,Their house-made ranch drizzle takes their pizzas to another level. It's not your typical ranch - has hints of dill and garlic with a perfect consistency that adds creaminess without making things soggy.

Perfect thin crust,2023-03-11,5,"If you're a thin crust fan, this is your place. Cracker-thin, crispy all the way through, yet somehow still has a nice chew. Their simple cheese pizza showcases their excellent sauce - slightly sweet with a nice herb blend."
Pizza barely survived the drive home,2023-12-12,2,"Ordered takeout and by the time I got home (15 minutes), the pizza was a soggy mess. They clearly don't use appropriate packaging for takeout - no vents to release steam means the crust steams itself into sogginess."
Doughy and undercooked,2024-03-24,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Perfect for lunch specials,2023-05-02,4,"Their lunch deal is unbeatable - $10 for a 10-inch pizza and small salad. The pizza comes out quickly, is always fresh, and the perfect size for one person. Great place for a work lunch."
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2024-06-28,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Toppings slide right off,2024-09-14,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Outstanding variety of options,2023-12-27,5,"Their menu has something for everyone - traditional options done well, creative specialties, and customizable choices. Even have dessert pizzas that are surprisingly good (try the Nutella and banana!)."
Excellent for takeout,2023-08-17,4,"Their pizza travels remarkably well. Even after a 20-minute drive home, the crust was still crispy and everything was at the perfect temperature. They have their packaging technique down to a science."
Perfect for kids' parties,2023-10-12,5,"Hosted my son's birthday here and it was fantastic. They did a dough-tossing demonstration for the kids, let them make their own mini pizzas, and the staff was incredibly patient and kind."
Too much cheese,2023-05-25,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Great gluten-free option,2023-08-07,4,"As someone with celiac disease, finding good gluten-free pizza is a challenge. Their cauliflower crust was one of the best I've had - doesn't fall apart and has a nice flavor. Toppings were generous too."
Best Hawaiian in the city,2025-04-12,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."
New owners ruined it,2025-01-14,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."
Excellent Chicago deep dish,2024-05-11,5,"Hard to find authentic Chicago-style pizza in this area, but they nail it. The buttery, flaky crust, the layering of cheese under the sauce, the chunky tomato topping - all perfect. Worth the 45-minute cook time."

Refrigerated dough taste,2025-06-26,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."
Stale-tasting crust,2023-02-08,2,"The crust had a stale, almost cardboard-like quality that suggests either old dough or old flour. Fresh ingredients on top couldn't compensate for the foundation being off."
Too much cornmeal,2025-03-18,3,"They use cornmeal on the bottom of the crust to prevent sticking, which is standard, but they use so much that it's like eating pizza on a sandpaper surface. Gritty texture overwhelms the experience."
Mediocre at best,2024-04-30,3,"Nothing terrible but nothing special either. The crust was okay, toppings were standard, and service was fine. It's the kind of place you go when you're in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip for."
Cheese solidified too quickly,2025-05-13,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Exceptional spinach ricotta pie,2024-04-10,5,Their white pizza with spinach and ricotta is exceptional - the creamy richness of the cheese balanced by the slight bitterness of the greens. The garlic-infused olive oil base ties everything together perfectly.
Outstanding breakfast pizza,2023-08-14,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
Perfect for large parties,2024-11-30,5,"Their party package is fantastic - multiple 18-inch pizzas with varied toppings, plenty of sides, and they were accommodating with our group of 20. Everything arrived hot and on time, and they included all the necessary paper goods."
Perfect balance of flavors,2023-04-17,5,"Their 'Mediterranean' pizza has the perfect balance of flavors - the briny olives, tangy feta, fresh tomatoes, and herb-infused olive oil all complement each other without any one element overwhelming the others."
Excellent Chicago deep dish,2023-07-29,5,"Hard to find authentic Chicago-style pizza in this area, but they nail it. The buttery, flaky crust, the layering of cheese under the sauce, the chunky tomato topping - all perfect. Worth the 45-minute cook time."

Too greasy to enjoy,2024-06-23,2,"Had to literally blot my pizza with napkins, which came away completely saturated with grease. Whatever flavor might have been there was drowned in oil. Couldn't finish it as it was making me feel ill."
Tasteless cheese substitute,2023-07-27,2,"Their vegan cheese option was terrible - had no meltability, a grainy texture, and tasted strongly of coconut which clashed with the tomato sauce. If you can't do vegan cheese well, better to offer cheese-free options that are properly balanced."
Refrigerated dough taste,2024-10-21,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."
Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2023-09-28,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
Painfully obvious cheap ingredients,2023-05-16,2,"The pre-shredded cheese didn't melt properly, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the sausage had that distinctive processed flavor. At these prices, cutting corners on ingredients is inexcusable."
Doughy and undercooked,2023-01-14,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2025-05-12,5,They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!
Excellent customer service,2025-02-23,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
Innovative flavor combinations,2023-11-21,5,"Their 'Avant Garde' menu section features combinations I would never have thought of but somehow work perfectly. The pear, gorgonzola, walnut, and honey pizza was a revelation of sweet, salty, and savory harmony."
Absurdly small slices,2023-03-04,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2024-04-14,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."
Perfect temperature every time,2024-01-12,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
Too much cheese,2024-03-16,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."

Cold center burnt edges,2023-04-29,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Too thin to be satisfying,2023-06-04,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Outstanding wood-fired perfection,2024-09-21,5,The wood-fired oven gives their pizza a distinctive smoky complexity you can't get any other way. The slight char adds bitterness that balances the sweetness of the sauce perfectly. Worth seeking out for this unique flavor profile.
Family night favorite,2023-10-01,5,"We bring our kids here every Friday night. The staff always make them feel special, providing dough for them to play with while we wait. Their kid-sized pizzas are perfect, and the parents love the craft beer selection."

Late night savior,2023-05-22,4,"Open until 2am on weekends, this place has saved me many times after a night out. Their slices are huge, reheated perfectly crisp, and they have creative toppings that hit the spot when you're hungry late at night."
Perfect buffalo mozzarella application,2024-07-07,5,They understand that buffalo mozzarella shouldn't be cooked too long or it loses its distinctive texture and flavor. Applied in dollops after the pizza is mostly baked so it just barely melts while maintaining its creamy integrity. Technical perfection!

Masterclass in proper baking,2023-12-12,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
Painfully obvious cheap ingredients,2023-02-01,2,"The pre-shredded cheese didn't melt properly, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the sausage had that distinctive processed flavor. At these prices, cutting corners on ingredients is inexcusable."
Brilliant seasonal rotation,2024-12-23,5,"Love that they have a rotating seasonal pizza that showcases what's fresh. The current spring offering with asparagus, green garlic, and fresh peas is bright and delicious - a perfect reflection of the season."
Perfect for picky eaters,2023-09-03,4,Their 'build your own quarter' option is genius - a large pizza divided into quadrants with different toppings. Perfect for our family where everyone wants something different. No more ordering multiple pizzas!
Excessive grease pooling,2023-02-24,2,"Had to continuously blot the pizza with napkins as pools of orange grease formed on top of the cheese with every passing minute. By the end, the napkins were completely saturated and transparent. Felt unhealthy even by pizza standards."
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2023-06-11,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Perfect crunch factor,2023-07-08,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."
Pizza barely survived the drive home,2024-08-14,2,"Ordered takeout and by the time I got home (15 minutes), the pizza was a soggy mess. They clearly don't use appropriate packaging for takeout - no vents to release steam means the crust steams itself into sogginess."

Excessive grease pooling,2024-04-07,2,"Had to continuously blot the pizza with napkins as pools of orange grease formed on top of the cheese with every passing minute. By the end, the napkins were completely saturated and transparent. Felt unhealthy even by pizza standards."
Too much sauce,2024-01-19,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Overpriced for what you get,2024-03-08,3,"$24 for a medium pizza with just two toppings seems excessive. The ingredients were fresh and the crust was good, but nothing justified the premium price. There are better values elsewhere in town."
Brilliant seasonal rotation,2023-02-17,5,"Love that they have a rotating seasonal pizza that showcases what's fresh. The current spring offering with asparagus, green garlic, and fresh peas is bright and delicious - a perfect reflection of the season."
Exceptional sauce-making technique,2025-06-19,5,"You can tell their sauce is made with properly hand-crushed tomatoes - it has that perfect texture with small chunks rather than being completely smooth. The bright flavor suggests minimal cooking, allowing the tomato quality to shine."
Too noisy for conversation,2023-09-02,3,The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option.
Excellent attention to cooking time,2025-03-13,5,They nail the cooking time perfectly - pulling the pizza from the oven at exactly the right moment when the cheese is fully melted and bubbling but not yet browned. Shows expertise and attention to detail.

Burned mouth on first bite,2024-04-25,2,"They served the pizza dangerously hot - barely out of the oven with no time to cool. Severely burned the roof of my mouth on the first bite, which ruined the rest of the meal and my next few days."
Masterful use of olive oil,2025-03-04,5,"The drizzle of high-quality olive oil they add just before serving makes all the difference - adds richness, enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, and adds a wonderful aromatic element. Simple but transformative."
Tasteless cheese substitute,2023-04-20,2,"Their vegan cheese option was terrible - had no meltability, a grainy texture, and tasted strongly of coconut which clashed with the tomato sauce. If you can't do vegan cheese well, better to offer cheese-free options that are properly balanced."
Skimpy on toppings,2024-03-16,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."

Too much garlic,2023-07-07,3,"I love garlic but this was excessive - felt like they mistook cloves for teaspoons in the recipe. My breath was lethal afterward, and the powerful flavor overwhelmed the other ingredients."
Toppings slide right off,2023-01-24,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2024-03-04,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies.

Spicy special was too much,2024-10-25,2,Their 'Firebreather' pizza should come with a warning label. It wasn't enjoyably spicy - it was painfully hot to the point where I couldn't taste anything else. Had to throw most of it away.
Too expensive for pizza,2025-06-18,3,"The pizza is good, I'll give them that. But $30 for a basic large cheese pizza is highway robbery. Add toppings and you're looking at $40-50. The quality doesn't justify these premium prices."
Excessive grease pooling,2023-09-24,2,"Had to continuously blot the pizza with napkins as pools of orange grease formed on top of the cheese with every passing minute. By the end, the napkins were completely saturated and transparent. Felt unhealthy even by pizza standards."

Epic meat lovers option,2025-01-12,4,"If you're a carnivore, their 'Butcher's Block' pizza is incredible. Five different meats, all high quality - the soppressata and house-made sausage are standouts. Just be ready for a food coma afterward!"
Cheese solidified too quickly,2025-04-22,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."

Lackluster veggie options,2024-11-23,3,"Their vegetable toppings lacked freshness and flavor - the mushrooms were clearly canned, the peppers were soft and faded, and the onions were sparse. Disappointing for a place that advertises farm-fresh ingredients."
Exceptional sauce-making technique,2023-11-21,5,"You can tell their sauce is made with properly hand-crushed tomatoes - it has that perfect texture with small chunks rather than being completely smooth. The bright flavor suggests minimal cooking, allowing the tomato quality to shine."

Perfect crust-to-topping ratio,2024-07-18,5,"Some places overload toppings so the crust gets soggy, others are too sparse. This place gets it perfect - enough toppings to get some in every bite, but not so much that the structural integrity is compromised."
Perfect crunch factor,2024-03-28,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."

Disappointed with service,2023-03-05,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."
Perfect temperature every time,2023-10-28,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."

Burned mouth on first bite,2023-12-21,2,"They served the pizza dangerously hot - barely out of the oven with no time to cool. Severely burned the roof of my mouth on the first bite, which ruined the rest of the meal and my next few days."
Masterclass in proper baking,2024-02-29,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
Too noisy for conversation,2023-03-10,3,The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option.
Tough leathery crust,2023-04-05,2,"The crust was so tough I almost couldn't bite through it - like trying to eat leather. The edges were particularly problematic, had to tear pieces off with significant effort. Completely lacks the pleasant chewiness good pizza should have."
Perfect balance of flavors,2023-08-04,5,"Their 'Mediterranean' pizza has the perfect balance of flavors - the briny olives, tangy feta, fresh tomatoes, and herb-infused olive oil all complement each other without any one element overwhelming the others."
Cheese solidified too quickly,2023-06-27,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Great gluten-free option,2025-03-03,4,"As someone with celiac disease, finding good gluten-free pizza is a challenge. Their cauliflower crust was one of the best I've had - doesn't fall apart and has a nice flavor. Toppings were generous too."
Spicy special was too much,2023-09-09,2,Their 'Firebreather' pizza should come with a warning label. It wasn't enjoyably spicy - it was painfully hot to the point where I couldn't taste anything else. Had to throw most of it away.
Perfect for dietary restrictions,2023-05-24,5,"As someone with multiple food allergies, I appreciate that they take dietary concerns seriously. Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"
Excellent Chicago deep dish,2024-02-17,5,"Hard to find authentic Chicago-style pizza in this area, but they nail it. The buttery, flaky crust, the layering of cheese under the sauce, the chunky tomato topping - all perfect. Worth the 45-minute cook time."
Way too much oregano,2023-04-16,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
Best pizza in town,2023-11-18,5,"The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Their signature pepperoni pizza had the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, and the pepperoni curled up into little cups of deliciousness. Will definitely be back!"
Too much sauce,2024-07-29,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Skimpy on toppings,2024-08-05,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."
Painfully obvious cheap ingredients,2024-03-17,2,"The pre-shredded cheese didn't melt properly, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the sausage had that distinctive processed flavor. At these prices, cutting corners on ingredients is inexcusable."
Perfect NY-style slices,2024-09-15,5,"As a transplant from NYC, I've been searching for authentic NY-style pizza. This place nails it - thin, foldable slices with the right amount of chew and grease. Their plain cheese slice is perfection."
Way too much crust,2024-02-15,2,The edge crust (cornicione) was comically large - almost half of each slice was just bread with no toppings. This ratio of crust to actual pizza was way off and made for a disappointing experience.
Excellent wine pairings,2024-03-15,5,"Their curated wine list is designed specifically to pair with their pizzas, and the staff is knowledgeable about suggesting the perfect match. The house red with their sausage pizza is a transcendent combination."
Best Hawaiian in the city,2023-04-14,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."
Righteous ranch drizzle,2024-02-02,5,Their house-made ranch drizzle takes their pizzas to another level. It's not your typical ranch - has hints of dill and garlic with a perfect consistency that adds creaminess without making things soggy.
Excellence in simplicity,2023-12-30,5,"Their classic Margherita showcases their commitment to quality - the balance of sweet-acidic tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella, fragrant basil, and that perfectly chewy-crisp crust. Proof that simple can be sublime."

Righteous ranch drizzle,2025-05-17,5,Their house-made ranch drizzle takes their pizzas to another level. It's not your typical ranch - has hints of dill and garlic with a perfect consistency that adds creaminess without making things soggy.
Too thin to be satisfying,2024-07-17,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Excellent Chicago deep dish,2024-07-11,5,"Hard to find authentic Chicago-style pizza in this area, but they nail it. The buttery, flaky crust, the layering of cheese under the sauce, the chunky tomato topping - all perfect. Worth the 45-minute cook time."
Incredible vodka sauce base,2024-12-07,5,"Their vodka sauce pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil is something special. The creamy, slightly spicy sauce is a perfect alternative to traditional tomato sauce. Add prosciutto for an extra flavor dimension!"
Best Hawaiian in the city,2023-05-03,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."
Cold center burnt edges,2023-10-18,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2025-01-27,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Innovative flavor combinations,2024-11-09,5,"Their 'Avant Garde' menu section features combinations I would never have thought of but somehow work perfectly. The pear, gorgonzola, walnut, and honey pizza was a revelation of sweet, salty, and savory harmony."
Masterful use of olive oil,2024-10-03,5,"The drizzle of high-quality olive oil they add just before serving makes all the difference - adds richness, enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, and adds a wonderful aromatic element. Simple but transformative."
Tough leathery crust,2024-09-04,2,"The crust was so tough I almost couldn't bite through it - like trying to eat leather. The edges were particularly problematic, had to tear pieces off with significant effort. Completely lacks the pleasant chewiness good pizza should have."
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2024-10-30,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
Unmelted cheese in the center,2023-06-13,2,"The edges were fine but the center had cold, unmelted cheese - a sign the oven wasn't hot enough or the pizza wasn't cooked long enough. Basic pizza fundamentals seem to be lacking."
Too expensive for pizza,2023-06-02,3,"The pizza is good, I'll give them that. But $30 for a basic large cheese pizza is highway robbery. Add toppings and you're looking at $40-50. The quality doesn't justify these premium prices."
Rude staff ruined the meal,2024-01-01,2,"The pizza itself was decent, but the counter staff was incredibly rude - sighing when I asked questions about ingredients, rushing my order, and actually rolling their eyes when I requested extra napkins."
Excessive grease pooling,2024-09-29,2,"Had to continuously blot the pizza with napkins as pools of orange grease formed on top of the cheese with every passing minute. By the end, the napkins were completely saturated and transparent. Felt unhealthy even by pizza standards."
New owners ruined it,2024-10-19,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."
Doughy and undercooked,2023-07-14,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Skimpy on toppings,2025-06-10,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."
Ideal char-to-chew ratio,2023-01-24,5,The small charred bubbles on the crust add amazing flavor without dominating. They've mastered that balance between the slight bitterness of char and the natural sweetness of the dough. Technical perfection!
Stale-tasting crust,2024-12-28,2,"The crust had a stale, almost cardboard-like quality that suggests either old dough or old flour. Fresh ingredients on top couldn't compensate for the foundation being off."
Pizza barely survived the drive home,2023-12-04,2,"Ordered takeout and by the time I got home (15 minutes), the pizza was a soggy mess. They clearly don't use appropriate packaging for takeout - no vents to release steam means the crust steams itself into sogginess."
Expert-level pizza folding,2024-04-23,5,Their thin-crust slices fold perfectly New York-style without cracking or losing toppings. The slight resistance before the fold is exactly what you want - showing the perfect balance of crisp and chew.
Greasy and disappointing,2023-11-18,2,"I had high hopes based on the reviews, but my pizza was swimming in grease. The crust was undercooked in the center, and the promised 'fresh vegetables' looked and tasted canned. Such a letdown."
Ideal char-to-chew ratio,2023-12-18,5,The small charred bubbles on the crust add amazing flavor without dominating. They've mastered that balance between the slight bitterness of char and the natural sweetness of the dough. Technical perfection!
Perfect for picky eaters,2023-02-04,4,Their 'build your own quarter' option is genius - a large pizza divided into quadrants with different toppings. Perfect for our family where everyone wants something different. No more ordering multiple pizzas!
Toppings slide right off,2024-06-05,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Creative seasonal specials,2024-03-22,5,"Just had their spring special with asparagus, lemon ricotta, and prosciutto. The combination was bright, fresh, and perfect for the season. Love that they use local, seasonal ingredients."
Terrible delivery experience,2023-10-17,1,"Ordered for Valentine's Day and regretted it. Pizza took 2 hours to arrive, was cold, and had the wrong toppings. Called the restaurant and they seemed completely unconcerned. Never again."

Exceptional sauce-making technique,2024-08-01,5,"You can tell their sauce is made with properly hand-crushed tomatoes - it has that perfect texture with small chunks rather than being completely smooth. The bright flavor suggests minimal cooking, allowing the tomato quality to shine."
Epic meat lovers option,2023-02-15,4,"If you're a carnivore, their 'Butcher's Block' pizza is incredible. Five different meats, all high quality - the soppressata and house-made sausage are standouts. Just be ready for a food coma afterward!"
Too salty,2023-01-03,2,"Everything I tried was oversalted - the crust, the sauce, and especially the cheese. It was like they were trying to ensure you'd order more drinks. Couldn't finish my pizza and was thirsty all night."
Rude staff ruined the meal,2024-04-22,2,"The pizza itself was decent, but the counter staff was incredibly rude - sighing when I asked questions about ingredients, rushing my order, and actually rolling their eyes when I requested extra napkins."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2023-09-13,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Outstanding wood-fired perfection,2025-03-18,5,The wood-fired oven gives their pizza a distinctive smoky complexity you can't get any other way. The slight char adds bitterness that balances the sweetness of the sauce perfectly. Worth seeking out for this unique flavor profile.

Tomato sauce tasted rancid,2024-06-23,1,"The sauce had a distinctly off flavor that suggested the tomatoes had gone bad before processing. After two bites, couldn't continue eating as the rancid notes became more pronounced. Basic food safety seems questionable."
Sauce like ketchup,2023-02-04,2,"The sauce was suspiciously sweet and one-dimensional, reminiscent of ketchup rather than a proper pizza sauce. No evidence of herbs, garlic, or any complexity. Ruined what otherwise could have been a decent pizza."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2025-01-09,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Hidden gem for vegans,2024-01-25,5,"I can't believe how good their vegan pizza is! They make their own cashew cheese that actually melts properly, and their vegetable toppings are always fresh and seasonal. Even my non-vegan friends love it."
Brilliant use of fermented dough,2023-03-12,5,Their 72-hour fermented dough has incredible depth of flavor with subtle sourdough notes. The extended fermentation creates a complex web of flavors and perfect texture that you simply can't achieve with quick-rise methods.

Perfect for large parties,2024-06-06,5,"Their party package is fantastic - multiple 18-inch pizzas with varied toppings, plenty of sides, and they were accommodating with our group of 20. Everything arrived hot and on time, and they included all the necessary paper goods."
Best pizza in town,2024-09-05,5,"The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Their signature pepperoni pizza had the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, and the pepperoni curled up into little cups of deliciousness. Will definitely be back!"

Weird aftertaste,2025-05-29,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."
Unmelted cheese in the center,2023-05-20,2,"The edges were fine but the center had cold, unmelted cheese - a sign the oven wasn't hot enough or the pizza wasn't cooked long enough. Basic pizza fundamentals seem to be lacking."
Authentic coal-fired perfection,2023-05-22,5,Their coal-fired oven gives the pizza a distinctive char and smoky flavor that's impossible to replicate any other way. The slight bitterness of the charred spots perfectly balances the sweetness of the sauce.
Masterclass in proper baking,2024-02-20,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
Dirty restaurant,2023-01-24,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."
Outstanding breakfast pizza,2024-06-23,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
Perfect ingredient distribution,2024-11-29,5,"Every bite had the perfect combination of ingredients - no barren spots, no overwhelming clumps. The toppings were distributed with such precision it almost seemed measured. The mark of true professionals!"
Perfect thin crust,2023-05-10,5,"If you're a thin crust fan, this is your place. Cracker-thin, crispy all the way through, yet somehow still has a nice chew. Their simple cheese pizza showcases their excellent sauce - slightly sweet with a nice herb blend."

Too noisy for conversation,2023-05-04,3,The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option.
Excellent customer service,2024-06-28,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
Perfect for dietary restrictions,2023-08-20,5,"As someone with multiple food allergies, I appreciate that they take dietary concerns seriously. Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"
Underwhelming and basic,2023-10-28,3,"Nothing particularly wrong with it, but nothing memorable either. Standard crust, standard sauce, standard toppings. In a city with so many pizza options, this place doesn't give you any reason to return."
Lackluster veggie options,2024-11-01,3,"Their vegetable toppings lacked freshness and flavor - the mushrooms were clearly canned, the peppers were soft and faded, and the onions were sparse. Disappointing for a place that advertises farm-fresh ingredients."
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2023-10-12,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Too much cornmeal,2025-01-22,3,"They use cornmeal on the bottom of the crust to prevent sticking, which is standard, but they use so much that it's like eating pizza on a sandpaper surface. Gritty texture overwhelms the experience."
Overpriced for what you get,2024-02-27,3,"$24 for a medium pizza with just two toppings seems excessive. The ingredients were fresh and the crust was good, but nothing justified the premium price. There are better values elsewhere in town."
Burnt crust ruins it,2024-07-21,2,"They claim 'char' is part of the Neapolitan experience, but there's a difference between char and burnt. The entire bottom of my pizza was black and bitter. Scraping it off meant losing half the crust."
Epic meat lovers option,2025-02-05,4,"If you're a carnivore, their 'Butcher's Block' pizza is incredible. Five different meats, all high quality - the soppressata and house-made sausage are standouts. Just be ready for a food coma afterward!"
Authentic Italian experience,2025-03-05,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
Not worth the wait,2025-06-27,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."

Authentic Italian experience,2023-10-23,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
False advertising on size,2024-11-26,2,"Their menu clearly states that a large pizza is 16 inches, but what we received couldn't have been more than 14 inches. When questioned, they claimed their menu was outdated but refused any adjustment."
Perfect for dietary restrictions,2024-06-10,5,"As someone with multiple food allergies, I appreciate that they take dietary concerns seriously. Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"
Refrigerated dough taste,2025-04-22,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."

Not enough cheese,2024-02-03,3,"The sauce and crust were good, but they're stingy with cheese. You could see the sauce through the sparse cheese layer, and what was there didn't have that stretchy pull you want from a good pizza."
Disappointed with service,2024-12-06,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."
Dirty restaurant,2025-01-10,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."
Righteous ranch drizzle,2024-05-12,5,Their house-made ranch drizzle takes their pizzas to another level. It's not your typical ranch - has hints of dill and garlic with a perfect consistency that adds creaminess without making things soggy.
Magnificent flavor layering,2025-03-23,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Too much sauce,2024-06-09,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Perfect pepperoni placement,2024-10-06,5,"As a pepperoni perfectionist, I appreciate that they space the pepperoni so every bite gets one full piece. No bare spots or clumped areas. Shows attention to detail that elevates the whole experience."
Tasteless cheese substitute,2024-09-20,2,"Their vegan cheese option was terrible - had no meltability, a grainy texture, and tasted strongly of coconut which clashed with the tomato sauce. If you can't do vegan cheese well, better to offer cheese-free options that are properly balanced."
Masterclass in proper baking,2023-06-13,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
Outstanding variety of options,2023-12-17,5,"Their menu has something for everyone - traditional options done well, creative specialties, and customizable choices. Even have dessert pizzas that are surprisingly good (try the Nutella and banana!)."

Greasy and disappointing,2023-05-12,2,"I had high hopes based on the reviews, but my pizza was swimming in grease. The crust was undercooked in the center, and the promised 'fresh vegetables' looked and tasted canned. Such a letdown."
Refrigerated dough taste,2025-02-04,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."
Exceptional spinach ricotta pie,2023-03-27,5,Their white pizza with spinach and ricotta is exceptional - the creamy richness of the cheese balanced by the slight bitterness of the greens. The garlic-infused olive oil base ties everything together perfectly.
Cold center burnt edges,2024-01-17,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Painfully obvious cheap ingredients,2023-10-28,2,"The pre-shredded cheese didn't melt properly, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the sausage had that distinctive processed flavor. At these prices, cutting corners on ingredients is inexcusable."

Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2023-01-16,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies. The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."
Excellent for takeout,2025-01-22,4,"Their pizza travels remarkably well. Even after a 20-minute drive home, the crust was still crispy and everything was at the perfect temperature. They have their packaging technique down to a science."
Inconsistent quality,2024-01-25,3,I've been here three times. First visit: amazing. Second: terrible. Third: just okay. Seems like it really depends on who's working that day. Wish they could maintain better quality control.
Undercooked in the middle,2024-08-09,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2024-06-11,5,They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!
Exceptional sauce-making technique,2023-03-22,5,"You can tell their sauce is made with properly hand-crushed tomatoes - it has that perfect texture with small chunks rather than being completely smooth. The bright flavor suggests minimal cooking, allowing the tomato quality to shine."
Too noisy for conversation,2023-12-21,3,The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option.
Perfect pepperoni placement,2025-01-03,5,"As a pepperoni perfectionist, I appreciate that they space the pepperoni so every bite gets one full piece. No bare spots or clumped areas. Shows attention to detail that elevates the whole experience."
Crispy yet chewy perfection,2024-12-25,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."
Crispy yet chewy perfection,2023-03-26,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."
Burnt crust ruins it,2023-03-19,2,"They claim 'char' is part of the Neapolitan experience, but there's a difference between char and burnt. The entire bottom of my pizza was black and bitter. Scraping it off meant losing half the crust."
Underwhelming and basic,2025-04-05,3,"Nothing particularly wrong with it, but nothing memorable either. Standard crust, standard sauce, standard toppings. In a city with so many pizza options, this place doesn't give you any reason to return."
Perfect NY-style slices,2024-05-17,5,"As a transplant from NYC, I've been searching for authentic NY-style pizza. This place nails it - thin, foldable slices with the right amount of chew and grease. Their plain cheese slice is perfection."
Innovative flavor combinations,2024-03-05,5,"Their 'Avant Garde' menu section features combinations I would never have thought of but somehow work perfectly. The pear, gorgonzola, walnut, and honey pizza was a revelation of sweet, salty, and savory harmony."
Doughy and undercooked,2024-05-30,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2024-03-11,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
Best white pizza ever,2025-01-29,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"
Crust like cardboard,2024-02-13,2,"The crust had all the flavor and texture of packing material - dry, tough, and completely devoid of character. Even the decent toppings couldn't save it. The foundation of good pizza is good dough, and this wasn't it."
Perfect temperature every time,2025-03-31,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
Creative seasonal specials,2024-05-04,5,"Just had their spring special with asparagus, lemon ricotta, and prosciutto. The combination was bright, fresh, and perfect for the season. Love that they use local, seasonal ingredients."
Perfect for dietary restrictions,2023-10-07,5,"As someone with multiple food allergies, I appreciate that they take dietary concerns seriously. Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"
Too much cornmeal,2025-02-10,3,"They use cornmeal on the bottom of the crust to prevent sticking, which is standard, but they use so much that it's like eating pizza on a sandpaper surface. Gritty texture overwhelms the experience."
Outstanding variety of options,2023-07-12,5,"Their menu has something for everyone - traditional options done well, creative specialties, and customizable choices. Even have dessert pizzas that are surprisingly good (try the Nutella and banana!)."
Too much salt in the dough,2024-04-20,2,The crust was so salty it was almost inedible - overwhelmed all the other flavors and left me incredibly thirsty afterward. A heavy hand with salt ruined what could have been a good pizza.
Weird aftertaste,2023-11-01,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."
Perfect crunch factor,2023-09-27,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."
Too much salt in the dough,2024-01-29,2,The crust was so salty it was almost inedible - overwhelmed all the other flavors and left me incredibly thirsty afterward. A heavy hand with salt ruined what could have been a good pizza.
Too much emphasis on appearance,2023-07-07,3,"The pizza was clearly designed to look good in photos - perfect symmetry, vibrant colors, photogenic cheese pull - but the flavor was underwhelming. Style over substance for the Instagram crowd."
Creative seasonal specials,2024-01-24,5,"Just had their spring special with asparagus, lemon ricotta, and prosciutto. The combination was bright, fresh, and perfect for the season. Love that they use local, seasonal ingredients."
Cold center burnt edges,2025-05-03,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Excellent Chicago deep dish,2023-08-26,5,"Hard to find authentic Chicago-style pizza in this area, but they nail it. The buttery, flaky crust, the layering of cheese under the sauce, the chunky tomato topping - all perfect. Worth the 45-minute cook time."
Perfect crunch factor,2024-12-02,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."
Authentic Italian experience,2023-04-21,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
Burnt crust ruins it,2024-10-09,2,"They claim 'char' is part of the Neapolitan experience, but there's a difference between char and burnt. The entire bottom of my pizza was black and bitter. Scraping it off meant losing half the crust."
Too much garlic,2024-09-06,3,"I love garlic but this was excessive - felt like they mistook cloves for teaspoons in the recipe. My breath was lethal afterward, and the powerful flavor overwhelmed the other ingredients."
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2025-05-25,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Family night favorite,2025-02-14,5,"We bring our kids here every Friday night. The staff always make them feel special, providing dough for them to play with while we wait. Their kid-sized pizzas are perfect, and the parents love the craft beer selection."
Perfect NY-style slices,2025-01-07,5,"As a transplant from NYC, I've been searching for authentic NY-style pizza. This place nails it - thin, foldable slices with the right amount of chew and grease. Their plain cheese slice is perfection."
Too much cornmeal,2024-02-02,3,"They use cornmeal on the bottom of the crust to prevent sticking, which is standard, but they use so much that it's like eating pizza on a sandpaper surface. Gritty texture overwhelms the experience."
Expert-level pizza folding,2025-03-24,5,Their thin-crust slices fold perfectly New York-style without cracking or losing toppings. The slight resistance before the fold is exactly what you want - showing the perfect balance of crisp and chew.
Rude staff ruined the meal,2024-09-08,2,"The pizza itself was decent, but the counter staff was incredibly rude - sighing when I asked questions about ingredients, rushing my order, and actually rolling their eyes when I requested extra napkins."
Skimpy on toppings,2023-08-19,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."
Too much cornmeal,2025-06-25,3,"They use cornmeal on the bottom of the crust to prevent sticking, which is standard, but they use so much that it's like eating pizza on a sandpaper surface. Gritty texture overwhelms the experience."
Tiny portion sizes,2024-10-07,2,"Their 'personal' pizza is the size of a CD. For $15, I expected something that would actually satisfy my hunger. Had to order a second one, turning a quick lunch into an expensive disappointment."
Terrible delivery experience,2023-07-21,1,"Ordered for Valentine's Day and regretted it. Pizza took 2 hours to arrive, was cold, and had the wrong toppings. Called the restaurant and they seemed completely unconcerned. Never again."
Painfully obvious cheap ingredients,2024-10-30,2,"The pre-shredded cheese didn't melt properly, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the sausage had that distinctive processed flavor. At these prices, cutting corners on ingredients is inexcusable."
Epic meat lovers option,2024-08-05,4,"If you're a carnivore, their 'Butcher's Block' pizza is incredible. Five different meats, all high quality - the soppressata and house-made sausage are standouts. Just be ready for a food coma afterward!"
All style no substance,2023-11-15,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."
Perfect for kids' parties,2023-11-14,5,"Hosted my son's birthday here and it was fantastic. They did a dough-tossing demonstration for the kids, let them make their own mini pizzas, and the staff was incredibly patient and kind."
Stale-tasting crust,2023-10-09,2,"The crust had a stale, almost cardboard-like quality that suggests either old dough or old flour. Fresh ingredients on top couldn't compensate for the foundation being off."
Sauce like ketchup,2025-01-10,2,"The sauce was suspiciously sweet and one-dimensional, reminiscent of ketchup rather than a proper pizza sauce. No evidence of herbs, garlic, or any complexity. Ruined what otherwise could have been a decent pizza."
Best Hawaiian in the city,2024-08-10,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."
Too much salt in the dough,2025-01-19,2,The crust was so salty it was almost inedible - overwhelmed all the other flavors and left me incredibly thirsty afterward. A heavy hand with salt ruined what could have been a good pizza.
Excellent for takeout,2024-10-30,4,"Their pizza travels remarkably well. Even after a 20-minute drive home, the crust was still crispy and everything was at the perfect temperature. They have their packaging technique down to a science."
Supreme quality control,2025-02-28,5,"Visited multiple times and the consistency is impressive - every pizza comes out identical to the last one, with the same excellent quality. Shows serious commitment to training and standards that's rare in casual dining."
Too thin to be satisfying,2023-01-17,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Unmelted cheese in the center,2023-04-13,2,"The edges were fine but the center had cold, unmelted cheese - a sign the oven wasn't hot enough or the pizza wasn't cooked long enough. Basic pizza fundamentals seem to be lacking."
Perfect textural contrast,2023-10-15,5,"The contrast between the crisp bottom, the tender interior crumb, the gooey cheese, and the slight resistance of the toppings creates a textural symphony. Each bite is interesting and satisfying in a different way."
Too noisy for conversation,2023-04-17,3,The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option.
Not enough cheese,2023-03-30,3,"The sauce and crust were good, but they're stingy with cheese. You could see the sauce through the sparse cheese layer, and what was there didn't have that stretchy pull you want from a good pizza."
Underwhelming and basic,2025-03-21,3,"Nothing particularly wrong with it, but nothing memorable either. Standard crust, standard sauce, standard toppings. In a city with so many pizza options, this place doesn't give you any reason to return."
Excellent beer pairing suggestions,2024-09-18,5,"Not only is their pizza excellent (try the fig and prosciutto!), but the staff is knowledgeable about their craft beer selection and can suggest the perfect pairing for whatever pizza you order."
Tiny portion sizes,2025-01-13,2,"Their 'personal' pizza is the size of a CD. For $15, I expected something that would actually satisfy my hunger. Had to order a second one, turning a quick lunch into an expensive disappointment."
Burned bottom raw top,2025-05-06,1,The bottom of the crust was completely black while the cheese on top wasn't fully melted. This temperature imbalance suggests serious issues with their oven management and pizza-making technique.
Cheese solidified too quickly,2023-07-24,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Supreme quality control,2024-04-20,5,"Visited multiple times and the consistency is impressive - every pizza comes out identical to the last one, with the same excellent quality. Shows serious commitment to training and standards that's rare in casual dining."
Cheese solidified too quickly,2025-03-06,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Inconsistent quality,2024-08-25,3,I've been here three times. First visit: amazing. Second: terrible. Third: just okay. Seems like it really depends on who's working that day. Wish they could maintain better quality control.
Brilliant use of fermented dough,2025-01-25,5,Their 72-hour fermented dough has incredible depth of flavor with subtle sourdough notes. The extended fermentation creates a complex web of flavors and perfect texture that you simply can't achieve with quick-rise methods.
Rude staff ruined the meal,2023-11-03,2,"The pizza itself was decent, but the counter staff was incredibly rude - sighing when I asked questions about ingredients, rushing my order, and actually rolling their eyes when I requested extra napkins."
Epic meat lovers option,2024-02-13,4,"If you're a carnivore, their 'Butcher's Block' pizza is incredible. Five different meats, all high quality - the soppressata and house-made sausage are standouts. Just be ready for a food coma afterward!"
Pizza arrived upside-down,2023-07-21,1,Delivery driver must have taken a sharp turn because our pizza arrived completely flipped over in the box - all toppings stuck to the lid. Restaurant offered no solution other than suggesting we 'scrape it off and reassemble it.'
Weird aftertaste,2024-06-26,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."
Bland sauce needs work,2023-10-01,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
Sloppy presentation,2023-08-22,3,"The pizza looked like it had been assembled in a hurry - toppings haphazardly thrown on, cheese unevenly distributed, and the cutting was so uneven that some slices were twice the size of others. Taste was okay, but appearance matters too."
Too greasy to enjoy,2024-04-17,2,"Had to literally blot my pizza with napkins, which came away completely saturated with grease. Whatever flavor might have been there was drowned in oil. Couldn't finish it as it was making me feel ill."
Too greasy to enjoy,2025-06-02,2,"Had to literally blot my pizza with napkins, which came away completely saturated with grease. Whatever flavor might have been there was drowned in oil. Couldn't finish it as it was making me feel ill."
Phenomenal crust,2023-07-24,5,"Whatever they do to their dough is magical - it's got that perfect combination of crispy and chewy with a slight sourdough tang. I could eat their plain crust by itself, it's that good."
Late night savior,2025-05-14,4,"Open until 2am on weekends, this place has saved me many times after a night out. Their slices are huge, reheated perfectly crisp, and they have creative toppings that hit the spot when you're hungry late at night."
Excellent Chicago deep dish,2023-10-05,5,"Hard to find authentic Chicago-style pizza in this area, but they nail it. The buttery, flaky crust, the layering of cheese under the sauce, the chunky tomato topping - all perfect. Worth the 45-minute cook time."
Authentic Italian experience,2024-11-12,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2023-05-08,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Family night favorite,2024-04-29,5,"We bring our kids here every Friday night. The staff always make them feel special, providing dough for them to play with while we wait. Their kid-sized pizzas are perfect, and the parents love the craft beer selection."
Creative seasonal specials,2024-03-23,5,"Just had their spring special with asparagus, lemon ricotta, and prosciutto. The combination was bright, fresh, and perfect for the season. Love that they use local, seasonal ingredients."
Righteous ranch drizzle,2023-06-23,5,Their house-made ranch drizzle takes their pizzas to another level. It's not your typical ranch - has hints of dill and garlic with a perfect consistency that adds creaminess without making things soggy.
Bland sauce needs work,2025-06-05,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
Too greasy to enjoy,2025-01-24,2,"Had to literally blot my pizza with napkins, which came away completely saturated with grease. Whatever flavor might have been there was drowned in oil. Couldn't finish it as it was making me feel ill."
Best Hawaiian in the city,2023-05-09,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."
Magnificent flavor layering,2025-01-30,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Perfectly crispy crust,2023-04-18,5,"However they achieve it, their crust has the perfect crispness all the way through - no soggy middle! Even the slices with lots of toppings maintain their structural integrity. Engineering marvel of pizza."
Sloppy presentation,2024-04-16,3,"The pizza looked like it had been assembled in a hurry - toppings haphazardly thrown on, cheese unevenly distributed, and the cutting was so uneven that some slices were twice the size of others. Taste was okay, but appearance matters too."
Perfect pepperoni placement,2024-05-07,5,"As a pepperoni perfectionist, I appreciate that they space the pepperoni so every bite gets one full piece. No bare spots or clumped areas. Shows attention to detail that elevates the whole experience."
Stale-tasting crust,2025-06-10,2,"The crust had a stale, almost cardboard-like quality that suggests either old dough or old flour. Fresh ingredients on top couldn't compensate for the foundation being off."
No flavor distinction,2023-08-29,3,Ordered two completely different specialty pizzas but they somehow tasted nearly identical. It's like they use the same base for everything and the toppings don't impart enough distinctive character.
Toppings slide right off,2024-12-30,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
New owners ruined it,2024-12-22,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."
Epic meat lovers option,2024-03-31,4,"If you're a carnivore, their 'Butcher's Block' pizza is incredible. Five different meats, all high quality - the soppressata and house-made sausage are standouts. Just be ready for a food coma afterward!"
Tough leathery crust,2023-02-22,2,"The crust was so tough I almost couldn't bite through it - like trying to eat leather. The edges were particularly problematic, had to tear pieces off with significant effort. Completely lacks the pleasant chewiness good pizza should have."
Best white pizza ever,2025-05-22,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"
Lackluster veggie options,2025-06-06,3,"Their vegetable toppings lacked freshness and flavor - the mushrooms were clearly canned, the peppers were soft and faded, and the onions were sparse. Disappointing for a place that advertises farm-fresh ingredients."
Undercooked in the middle,2023-09-15,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."
Burnt crust ruins it,2025-04-30,2,"They claim 'char' is part of the Neapolitan experience, but there's a difference between char and burnt. The entire bottom of my pizza was black and bitter. Scraping it off meant losing half the crust."
Masterful use of olive oil,2023-03-14,5,"The drizzle of high-quality olive oil they add just before serving makes all the difference - adds richness, enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, and adds a wonderful aromatic element. Simple but transformative."
Excellent Chicago deep dish,2025-04-12,5,"Hard to find authentic Chicago-style pizza in this area, but they nail it. The buttery, flaky crust, the layering of cheese under the sauce, the chunky tomato topping - all perfect. Worth the 45-minute cook time."
Ideal char-to-chew ratio,2025-06-27,5,The small charred bubbles on the crust add amazing flavor without dominating. They've mastered that balance between the slight bitterness of char and the natural sweetness of the dough. Technical perfection!
Excellent attention to cooking time,2025-01-29,5,They nail the cooking time perfectly - pulling the pizza from the oven at exactly the right moment when the cheese is fully melted and bubbling but not yet browned. Shows expertise and attention to detail.
Stale-tasting crust,2023-08-07,2,"The crust had a stale, almost cardboard-like quality that suggests either old dough or old flour. Fresh ingredients on top couldn't compensate for the foundation being off."
Cheese solidified too quickly,2023-02-05,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Excellent for takeout,2024-05-03,4,"Their pizza travels remarkably well. Even after a 20-minute drive home, the crust was still crispy and everything was at the perfect temperature. They have their packaging technique down to a science."
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2023-06-28,5,They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!
Rude staff ruined the meal,2025-02-09,2,"The pizza itself was decent, but the counter staff was incredibly rude - sighing when I asked questions about ingredients, rushing my order, and actually rolling their eyes when I requested extra napkins."
Innovative toppings,2023-05-10,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."
Sauce like ketchup,2024-07-18,2,"The sauce was suspiciously sweet and one-dimensional, reminiscent of ketchup rather than a proper pizza sauce. No evidence of herbs, garlic, or any complexity. Ruined what otherwise could have been a decent pizza."
Perfect for late-night cravings,2024-12-08,5,"Open until 3am on weekends, this place has saved many late nights. The slices are huge, they reheat them perfectly so they're crispy, and their special late-night menu items are creative and delicious."
Authentic Italian experience,2023-05-16,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
No-cheese option was all sauce,2023-12-18,2,"Ordered a cheese-free pizza for my dairy-allergic friend, but they made no adjustments - just removed the cheese and left a soggy sauce-covered bread. Good pizza without cheese requires rebalancing other elements."
Exceptional spinach ricotta pie,2023-12-19,5,Their white pizza with spinach and ricotta is exceptional - the creamy richness of the cheese balanced by the slight bitterness of the greens. The garlic-infused olive oil base ties everything together perfectly.
Best Hawaiian in the city,2024-02-02,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."
Superior ingredients make the difference,2024-06-26,5,"They import their flour from Italy, use San Marzano tomatoes, and make their mozzarella in-house daily. The commitment to quality ingredients is evident in every bite - nothing is an afterthought."
Best pizza in town,2024-03-22,5,"The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Their signature pepperoni pizza had the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, and the pepperoni curled up into little cups of deliciousness. Will definitely be back!"
Perfect for large parties,2023-03-07,5,"Their party package is fantastic - multiple 18-inch pizzas with varied toppings, plenty of sides, and they were accommodating with our group of 20. Everything arrived hot and on time, and they included all the necessary paper goods."
Perfectly crispy crust,2024-03-12,5,"However they achieve it, their crust has the perfect crispness all the way through - no soggy middle! Even the slices with lots of toppings maintain their structural integrity. Engineering marvel of pizza."
Absurdly small slices,2024-02-23,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."
Tiny portion sizes,2024-06-02,2,"Their 'personal' pizza is the size of a CD. For $15, I expected something that would actually satisfy my hunger. Had to order a second one, turning a quick lunch into an expensive disappointment."
Brilliant seasonal rotation,2023-09-18,5,"Love that they have a rotating seasonal pizza that showcases what's fresh. The current spring offering with asparagus, green garlic, and fresh peas is bright and delicious - a perfect reflection of the season."
Excellence in simplicity,2023-04-11,5,"Their classic Margherita showcases their commitment to quality - the balance of sweet-acidic tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella, fragrant basil, and that perfectly chewy-crisp crust. Proof that simple can be sublime."
Authentic coal-fired perfection,2024-07-16,5,Their coal-fired oven gives the pizza a distinctive char and smoky flavor that's impossible to replicate any other way. The slight bitterness of the charred spots perfectly balances the sweetness of the sauce.
Cheese solidified too quickly,2023-02-16,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Perfect NY-style slices,2024-10-28,5,"As a transplant from NYC, I've been searching for authentic NY-style pizza. This place nails it - thin, foldable slices with the right amount of chew and grease. Their plain cheese slice is perfection."
Excellent customer service,2023-11-22,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
Not enough cheese,2025-03-04,3,"The sauce and crust were good, but they're stingy with cheese. You could see the sauce through the sparse cheese layer, and what was there didn't have that stretchy pull you want from a good pizza."
Too thin to be satisfying,2023-03-23,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Excessive grease pooling,2023-12-28,2,"Had to continuously blot the pizza with napkins as pools of orange grease formed on top of the cheese with every passing minute. By the end, the napkins were completely saturated and transparent. Felt unhealthy even by pizza standards."
Too much garlic,2023-01-02,3,"I love garlic but this was excessive - felt like they mistook cloves for teaspoons in the recipe. My breath was lethal afterward, and the powerful flavor overwhelmed the other ingredients."
Too much cheese,2024-02-21,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Perfect for large parties,2025-02-06,5,"Their party package is fantastic - multiple 18-inch pizzas with varied toppings, plenty of sides, and they were accommodating with our group of 20. Everything arrived hot and on time, and they included all the necessary paper goods."
Inconsistent quality,2024-03-25,3,I've been here three times. First visit: amazing. Second: terrible. Third: just okay. Seems like it really depends on who's working that day. Wish they could maintain better quality control.
Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2023-12-02,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies. The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."
Weird aftertaste,2024-02-23,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."
Perfect for big groups,2024-12-25,5,"We had a party of 12 and they accommodated us perfectly. Their 20-inch shareable pizzas are great for groups, and they were happy to do half-and-half toppings to please everyone. Service was impressively coordinated."
Too much salt in the dough,2024-02-15,2,The crust was so salty it was almost inedible - overwhelmed all the other flavors and left me incredibly thirsty afterward. A heavy hand with salt ruined what could have been a good pizza.
Overpriced for what you get,2025-04-07,3,"$24 for a medium pizza with just two toppings seems excessive. The ingredients were fresh and the crust was good, but nothing justified the premium price. There are better values elsewhere in town."
Too expensive for pizza,2024-07-11,3,"The pizza is good, I'll give them that. But $30 for a basic large cheese pizza is highway robbery. Add toppings and you're looking at $40-50. The quality doesn't justify these premium prices."
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2023-08-07,5,They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!
False advertising on ingredients,2024-06-08,1,"Menu promised 'house-made Italian sausage' but what came on my pizza was clearly pre-formed, uniform pellets of commercial sausage. When questioned, staff admitted they don't make any ingredients in-house despite menu claims."
Crust like cardboard,2025-05-13,2,"The crust had all the flavor and texture of packing material - dry, tough, and completely devoid of character. Even the decent toppings couldn't save it. The foundation of good pizza is good dough, and this wasn't it."
Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2023-02-22,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
Ideal char-to-chew ratio,2023-05-22,5,The small charred bubbles on the crust add amazing flavor without dominating. They've mastered that balance between the slight bitterness of char and the natural sweetness of the dough. Technical perfection!
Brilliant use of fermented dough,2025-03-21,5,Their 72-hour fermented dough has incredible depth of flavor with subtle sourdough notes. The extended fermentation creates a complex web of flavors and perfect texture that you simply can't achieve with quick-rise methods.
Incredible vodka sauce base,2024-11-30,5,"Their vodka sauce pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil is something special. The creamy, slightly spicy sauce is a perfect alternative to traditional tomato sauce. Add prosciutto for an extra flavor dimension!"
Toppings slide right off,2024-10-13,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Best white pizza ever,2025-04-15,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"
Innovative toppings,2025-02-04,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."
No flavor distinction,2024-10-20,3,Ordered two completely different specialty pizzas but they somehow tasted nearly identical. It's like they use the same base for everything and the toppings don't impart enough distinctive character.
Lackluster veggie options,2024-07-11,3,"Their vegetable toppings lacked freshness and flavor - the mushrooms were clearly canned, the peppers were soft and faded, and the onions were sparse. Disappointing for a place that advertises farm-fresh ingredients."
Outstanding variety of options,2024-10-29,5,"Their menu has something for everyone - traditional options done well, creative specialties, and customizable choices. Even have dessert pizzas that are surprisingly good (try the Nutella and banana!)."
Authentic Italian experience,2025-04-18,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
Excellent for takeout,2023-10-11,4,"Their pizza travels remarkably well. Even after a 20-minute drive home, the crust was still crispy and everything was at the perfect temperature. They have their packaging technique down to a science."
Excellent wine pairings,2023-07-07,5,"Their curated wine list is designed specifically to pair with their pizzas, and the staff is knowledgeable about suggesting the perfect match. The house red with their sausage pizza is a transcendent combination."
Crust like cardboard,2024-06-03,2,"The crust had all the flavor and texture of packing material - dry, tough, and completely devoid of character. Even the decent toppings couldn't save it. The foundation of good pizza is good dough, and this wasn't it."
Doughy and undercooked,2023-04-23,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Masterclass in proper baking,2024-04-07,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
Crispy yet chewy perfection,2024-03-15,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."
Perfect pepperoni placement,2024-04-04,5,"As a pepperoni perfectionist, I appreciate that they space the pepperoni so every bite gets one full piece. No bare spots or clumped areas. Shows attention to detail that elevates the whole experience."
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2023-09-13,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2024-04-05,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Disappointed with service,2023-04-26,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."
Tiny portion sizes,2024-08-11,2,"Their 'personal' pizza is the size of a CD. For $15, I expected something that would actually satisfy my hunger. Had to order a second one, turning a quick lunch into an expensive disappointment."
Too noisy for conversation,2023-09-22,3,The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option.
Outstanding breakfast pizza,2024-07-30,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
Cold center burnt edges,2024-08-07,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Excellent beer pairing suggestions,2024-06-05,5,"Not only is their pizza excellent (try the fig and prosciutto!), but the staff is knowledgeable about their craft beer selection and can suggest the perfect pairing for whatever pizza you order."
Way too much oregano,2023-03-05,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
Magnificent flavor layering,2023-08-07,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Lackluster veggie options,2023-01-07,3,"Their vegetable toppings lacked freshness and flavor - the mushrooms were clearly canned, the peppers were soft and faded, and the onions were sparse. Disappointing for a place that advertises farm-fresh ingredients."
Undercooked in the middle,2025-01-25,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."
Masterclass in proper baking,2023-01-27,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
Perfect for picky eaters,2024-01-05,4,Their 'build your own quarter' option is genius - a large pizza divided into quadrants with different toppings. Perfect for our family where everyone wants something different. No more ordering multiple pizzas!
Bland sauce needs work,2024-05-07,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
Too noisy for conversation,2024-06-30,3,The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option.
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2023-05-14,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Skimpy on toppings,2025-03-17,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."
Skimpy on toppings,2023-01-21,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."
Supreme quality control,2025-01-21,5,"Visited multiple times and the consistency is impressive - every pizza comes out identical to the last one, with the same excellent quality. Shows serious commitment to training and standards that's rare in casual dining."
Doughy and undercooked,2025-03-29,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Innovative toppings,2025-02-03,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."
Tough leathery crust,2023-10-16,2,"The crust was so tough I almost couldn't bite through it - like trying to eat leather. The edges were particularly problematic, had to tear pieces off with significant effort. Completely lacks the pleasant chewiness good pizza should have."
Creative seasonal specials,2024-05-05,5,"Just had their spring special with asparagus, lemon ricotta, and prosciutto. The combination was bright, fresh, and perfect for the season. Love that they use local, seasonal ingredients."
Spicy special was too much,2023-12-12,2,Their 'Firebreather' pizza should come with a warning label. It wasn't enjoyably spicy - it was painfully hot to the point where I couldn't taste anything else. Had to throw most of it away.
Underwhelming and basic,2024-08-18,3,"Nothing particularly wrong with it, but nothing memorable either. Standard crust, standard sauce, standard toppings. In a city with so many pizza options, this place doesn't give you any reason to return."
Terrible delivery experience,2024-01-15,1,"Ordered for Valentine's Day and regretted it. Pizza took 2 hours to arrive, was cold, and had the wrong toppings. Called the restaurant and they seemed completely unconcerned. Never again."
Pizza arrived upside-down,2024-10-20,1,Delivery driver must have taken a sharp turn because our pizza arrived completely flipped over in the box - all toppings stuck to the lid. Restaurant offered no solution other than suggesting we 'scrape it off and reassemble it.'
Too thin to be satisfying,2024-04-07,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Sloppy presentation,2024-01-27,3,"The pizza looked like it had been assembled in a hurry - toppings haphazardly thrown on, cheese unevenly distributed, and the cutting was so uneven that some slices were twice the size of others. Taste was okay, but appearance matters too."
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2023-11-22,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Pizza barely survived the drive home,2025-01-23,2,"Ordered takeout and by the time I got home (15 minutes), the pizza was a soggy mess. They clearly don't use appropriate packaging for takeout - no vents to release steam means the crust steams itself into sogginess."
Magnificent flavor layering,2024-03-22,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Perfect ingredient distribution,2024-04-07,5,"Every bite had the perfect combination of ingredients - no barren spots, no overwhelming clumps. The toppings were distributed with such precision it almost seemed measured. The mark of true professionals!"
Undercooked in the middle,2023-09-11,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."
New owners ruined it,2025-02-25,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."
Burnt crust ruins it,2024-04-24,2,"They claim 'char' is part of the Neapolitan experience, but there's a difference between char and burnt. The entire bottom of my pizza was black and bitter. Scraping it off meant losing half the crust."
Perfect for lunch specials,2023-11-28,4,"Their lunch deal is unbeatable - $10 for a 10-inch pizza and small salad. The pizza comes out quickly, is always fresh, and the perfect size for one person. Great place for a work lunch."
Perfect for large parties,2025-03-04,5,"Their party package is fantastic - multiple 18-inch pizzas with varied toppings, plenty of sides, and they were accommodating with our group of 20. Everything arrived hot and on time, and they included all the necessary paper goods."
Refrigerated dough taste,2023-07-22,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."
Too much cornmeal,2025-04-22,3,"They use cornmeal on the bottom of the crust to prevent sticking, which is standard, but they use so much that it's like eating pizza on a sandpaper surface. Gritty texture overwhelms the experience."
Too much garlic,2023-03-18,3,"I love garlic but this was excessive - felt like they mistook cloves for teaspoons in the recipe. My breath was lethal afterward, and the powerful flavor overwhelmed the other ingredients."
Great gluten-free option,2025-06-12,4,"As someone with celiac disease, finding good gluten-free pizza is a challenge. Their cauliflower crust was one of the best I've had - doesn't fall apart and has a nice flavor. Toppings were generous too."
Excellent for takeout,2023-12-13,4,"Their pizza travels remarkably well. Even after a 20-minute drive home, the crust was still crispy and everything was at the perfect temperature. They have their packaging technique down to a science."
New owners ruined it,2023-06-27,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."
Hidden gem for vegans,2023-02-09,5,"I can't believe how good their vegan pizza is! They make their own cashew cheese that actually melts properly, and their vegetable toppings are always fresh and seasonal. Even my non-vegan friends love it."
Ideal char-to-chew ratio,2024-06-08,5,The small charred bubbles on the crust add amazing flavor without dominating. They've mastered that balance between the slight bitterness of char and the natural sweetness of the dough. Technical perfection!
Amazing Detroit-style,2023-01-14,5,"Their Detroit-style square pizza is incredible - crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior, and those corner pieces are to die for! The pepperoni cup and char perfectly. Worth the 30-minute wait."
Too expensive for pizza,2025-05-29,3,"The pizza is good, I'll give them that. But $30 for a basic large cheese pizza is highway robbery. Add toppings and you're looking at $40-50. The quality doesn't justify these premium prices."
Perfect balance of flavors,2023-03-05,5,"Their 'Mediterranean' pizza has the perfect balance of flavors - the briny olives, tangy feta, fresh tomatoes, and herb-infused olive oil all complement each other without any one element overwhelming the others."
Authentic Italian experience,2023-10-23,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
Perfect temperature every time,2024-02-18,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
Perfect crunch factor,2023-01-02,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."
Epic meat lovers option,2023-08-15,4,"If you're a carnivore, their 'Butcher's Block' pizza is incredible. Five different meats, all high quality - the soppressata and house-made sausage are standouts. Just be ready for a food coma afterward!"
Exceptional spinach ricotta pie,2024-05-13,5,Their white pizza with spinach and ricotta is exceptional - the creamy richness of the cheese balanced by the slight bitterness of the greens. The garlic-infused olive oil base ties everything together perfectly.
Too noisy for conversation,2023-06-06,3,The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option.
Sloppy presentation,2023-04-08,3,"The pizza looked like it had been assembled in a hurry - toppings haphazardly thrown on, cheese unevenly distributed, and the cutting was so uneven that some slices were twice the size of others. Taste was okay, but appearance matters too."

Spicy special was too much,2024-08-04,2,Their 'Firebreather' pizza should come with a warning label. It wasn't enjoyably spicy - it was painfully hot to the point where I couldn't taste anything else. Had to throw most of it away.
Mediocre at best,2023-10-17,3,"Nothing terrible but nothing special either. The crust was okay, toppings were standard, and service was fine. It's the kind of place you go when you're in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip for."
Way too much crust,2024-10-09,2,The edge crust (cornicione) was comically large - almost half of each slice was just bread with no toppings. This ratio of crust to actual pizza was way off and made for a disappointing experience.
Perfect NY-style slices,2023-12-24,5,"As a transplant from NYC, I've been searching for authentic NY-style pizza. This place nails it - thin, foldable slices with the right amount of chew and grease. Their plain cheese slice is perfection."
Perfect for watching sports,2024-10-15,4,"Great setup with TVs visible from every table, excellent pitcher specials during games, and their 'Game Day' pizza loaded with multiple meats and jalapeños is the perfect sports-watching food. Atmosphere gets lively but not obnoxious."
Too much cheese,2023-10-24,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Burnt crust ruins it,2024-12-07,2,"They claim 'char' is part of the Neapolitan experience, but there's a difference between char and burnt. The entire bottom of my pizza was black and bitter. Scraping it off meant losing half the crust."
Excellent attention to cooking time,2025-03-12,5,They nail the cooking time perfectly - pulling the pizza from the oven at exactly the right moment when the cheese is fully melted and bubbling but not yet browned. Shows expertise and attention to detail.
Undercooked in the middle,2024-05-11,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."
Innovative flavor combinations,2024-03-03,5,"Their 'Avant Garde' menu section features combinations I would never have thought of but somehow work perfectly. The pear, gorgonzola, walnut, and honey pizza was a revelation of sweet, salty, and savory harmony."
No flavor distinction,2024-10-10,3,Ordered two completely different specialty pizzas but they somehow tasted nearly identical. It's like they use the same base for everything and the toppings don't impart enough distinctive character.
Magnificent flavor layering,2024-04-14,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Perfect temperature every time,2024-03-26,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."

Toppings slide right off,2025-05-19,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Best pizza in town,2023-06-28,5,"The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Their signature pepperoni pizza had the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, and the pepperoni curled up into little cups of deliciousness. Will definitely be back!"
Exceptional sauce-making technique,2023-07-25,5,"You can tell their sauce is made with properly hand-crushed tomatoes - it has that perfect texture with small chunks rather than being completely smooth. The bright flavor suggests minimal cooking, allowing the tomato quality to shine."

Excellent wine pairings,2023-09-04,5,"Their curated wine list is designed specifically to pair with their pizzas, and the staff is knowledgeable about suggesting the perfect match. The house red with their sausage pizza is a transcendent combination."

False advertising on ingredients,2024-08-02,1,"Menu promised 'house-made Italian sausage' but what came on my pizza was clearly pre-formed, uniform pellets of commercial sausage. When questioned, staff admitted they don't make any ingredients in-house despite menu claims."
Excellent customer service,2025-04-02,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
Perfectly crispy crust,2024-05-17,5,"However they achieve it, their crust has the perfect crispness all the way through - no soggy middle! Even the slices with lots of toppings maintain their structural integrity. Engineering marvel of pizza."
Too greasy to enjoy,2024-08-21,2,"Had to literally blot my pizza with napkins, which came away completely saturated with grease. Whatever flavor might have been there was drowned in oil. Couldn't finish it as it was making me feel ill."
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2023-06-20,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
Too noisy for conversation,2023-01-09,3,The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option.
Doughy and undercooked,2025-04-06,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Tomato sauce tasted rancid,2025-04-25,1,"The sauce had a distinctly off flavor that suggested the tomatoes had gone bad before processing. After two bites, couldn't continue eating as the rancid notes became more pronounced. Basic food safety seems questionable."
Too much sauce,2023-10-23,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Perfect for large parties,2024-03-12,5,"Their party package is fantastic - multiple 18-inch pizzas with varied toppings, plenty of sides, and they were accommodating with our group of 20. Everything arrived hot and on time, and they included all the necessary paper goods."
Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2024-03-16,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies. The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."
Sauce like ketchup,2024-03-09,2,"The sauce was suspiciously sweet and one-dimensional, reminiscent of ketchup rather than a proper pizza sauce. No evidence of herbs, garlic, or any complexity. Ruined what otherwise could have been a decent pizza."
Outstanding wood-fired perfection,2024-08-05,5,The wood-fired oven gives their pizza a distinctive smoky complexity you can't get any other way. The slight char adds bitterness that balances the sweetness of the sauce perfectly. Worth seeking out for this unique flavor profile.
Absurdly small slices,2023-01-05,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2023-01-09,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Unmelted cheese in the center,2023-09-27,2,"The edges were fine but the center had cold, unmelted cheese - a sign the oven wasn't hot enough or the pizza wasn't cooked long enough. Basic pizza fundamentals seem to be lacking."
Perfect NY-style slices,2024-07-19,5,"As a transplant from NYC, I've been searching for authentic NY-style pizza. This place nails it - thin, foldable slices with the right amount of chew and grease. Their plain cheese slice is perfection."
New owners ruined it,2023-09-06,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."
Perfect for large parties,2024-10-29,5,"Their party package is fantastic - multiple 18-inch pizzas with varied toppings, plenty of sides, and they were accommodating with our group of 20. Everything arrived hot and on time, and they included all the necessary paper goods."
Ideal char-to-chew ratio,2023-10-17,5,The small charred bubbles on the crust add amazing flavor without dominating. They've mastered that balance between the slight bitterness of char and the natural sweetness of the dough. Technical perfection!
Too expensive for pizza,2024-03-05,3,"The pizza is good, I'll give them that. But $30 for a basic large cheese pizza is highway robbery. Add toppings and you're looking at $40-50. The quality doesn't justify these premium prices."
Too much sauce,2023-05-04,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Magnificent flavor layering,2025-02-25,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Terrible delivery experience,2025-03-16,1,"Ordered for Valentine's Day and regretted it. Pizza took 2 hours to arrive, was cold, and had the wrong toppings. Called the restaurant and they seemed completely unconcerned. Never again."
Excessive grease pooling,2024-06-07,2,"Had to continuously blot the pizza with napkins as pools of orange grease formed on top of the cheese with every passing minute. By the end, the napkins were completely saturated and transparent. Felt unhealthy even by pizza standards."
Cold center burnt edges,2023-02-07,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Outstanding breakfast pizza,2023-05-30,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
Painfully obvious cheap ingredients,2024-01-26,2,"The pre-shredded cheese didn't melt properly, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the sausage had that distinctive processed flavor. At these prices, cutting corners on ingredients is inexcusable."
Tough leathery crust,2023-06-10,2,"The crust was so tough I almost couldn't bite through it - like trying to eat leather. The edges were particularly problematic, had to tear pieces off with significant effort. Completely lacks the pleasant chewiness good pizza should have."
Perfect textural contrast,2025-02-13,5,"The contrast between the crisp bottom, the tender interior crumb, the gooey cheese, and the slight resistance of the toppings creates a textural symphony. Each bite is interesting and satisfying in a different way."
Perfect for late-night cravings,2023-10-30,5,"Open until 3am on weekends, this place has saved many late nights. The slices are huge, they reheat them perfectly so they're crispy, and their special late-night menu items are creative and delicious."
Perfect temperature every time,2023-09-16,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
Excellence in simplicity,2025-04-23,5,"Their classic Margherita showcases their commitment to quality - the balance of sweet-acidic tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella, fragrant basil, and that perfectly chewy-crisp crust. Proof that simple can be sublime."
Late night savior,2023-03-14,4,"Open until 2am on weekends, this place has saved me many times after a night out. Their slices are huge, reheated perfectly crisp, and they have creative toppings that hit the spot when you're hungry late at night."
Creative seasonal specials,2024-11-27,5,"Just had their spring special with asparagus, lemon ricotta, and prosciutto. The combination was bright, fresh, and perfect for the season. Love that they use local, seasonal ingredients."
Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2024-01-30,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies. The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."
Lackluster veggie options,2023-06-06,3,"Their vegetable toppings lacked freshness and flavor - the mushrooms were clearly canned, the peppers were soft and faded, and the onions were sparse. Disappointing for a place that advertises farm-fresh ingredients."
Excellent for takeout,2023-08-03,4,"Their pizza travels remarkably well. Even after a 20-minute drive home, the crust was still crispy and everything was at the perfect temperature. They have their packaging technique down to a science."
Epic meat lovers option,2024-05-14,4,"If you're a carnivore, their 'Butcher's Block' pizza is incredible. Five different meats, all high quality - the soppressata and house-made sausage are standouts. Just be ready for a food coma afterward!"
Great gluten-free option,2025-02-26,4,"As someone with celiac disease, finding good gluten-free pizza is a challenge. Their cauliflower crust was one of the best I've had - doesn't fall apart and has a nice flavor. Toppings were generous too."
Bland sauce needs work,2023-04-20,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
Great gluten-free option,2023-03-25,4,"As someone with celiac disease, finding good gluten-free pizza is a challenge. Their cauliflower crust was one of the best I've had - doesn't fall apart and has a nice flavor. Toppings were generous too."
Not enough cheese,2023-12-26,3,"The sauce and crust were good, but they're stingy with cheese. You could see the sauce through the sparse cheese layer, and what was there didn't have that stretchy pull you want from a good pizza."
Pizza arrived upside-down,2024-06-16,1,Delivery driver must have taken a sharp turn because our pizza arrived completely flipped over in the box - all toppings stuck to the lid. Restaurant offered no solution other than suggesting we 'scrape it off and reassemble it.'
Phenomenal crust,2023-02-14,5,"Whatever they do to their dough is magical - it's got that perfect combination of crispy and chewy with a slight sourdough tang. I could eat their plain crust by itself, it's that good."
Unmelted cheese in the center,2023-11-23,2,"The edges were fine but the center had cold, unmelted cheese - a sign the oven wasn't hot enough or the pizza wasn't cooked long enough. Basic pizza fundamentals seem to be lacking."
Cheese solidified too quickly,2024-06-20,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Cold center burnt edges,2025-03-08,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Too much cheese,2025-06-01,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Brilliant seasonal rotation,2023-02-06,5,"Love that they have a rotating seasonal pizza that showcases what's fresh. The current spring offering with asparagus, green garlic, and fresh peas is bright and delicious - a perfect reflection of the season."
New owners ruined it,2024-03-09,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."
Too much garlic,2024-06-19,3,"I love garlic but this was excessive - felt like they mistook cloves for teaspoons in the recipe. My breath was lethal afterward, and the powerful flavor overwhelmed the other ingredients."
Tomato sauce tasted rancid,2023-07-29,1,"The sauce had a distinctly off flavor that suggested the tomatoes had gone bad before processing. After two bites, couldn't continue eating as the rancid notes became more pronounced. Basic food safety seems questionable."
Best white pizza ever,2024-07-11,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"
Creative seasonal specials,2024-08-16,5,"Just had their spring special with asparagus, lemon ricotta, and prosciutto. The combination was bright, fresh, and perfect for the season. Love that they use local, seasonal ingredients."
Masterful use of olive oil,2023-12-31,5,"The drizzle of high-quality olive oil they add just before serving makes all the difference - adds richness, enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, and adds a wonderful aromatic element. Simple but transformative."
Not worth the wait,2025-06-30,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."
Pizza barely survived the drive home,2025-05-08,2,"Ordered takeout and by the time I got home (15 minutes), the pizza was a soggy mess. They clearly don't use appropriate packaging for takeout - no vents to release steam means the crust steams itself into sogginess."
Perfect for late-night cravings,2024-04-28,5,"Open until 3am on weekends, this place has saved many late nights. The slices are huge, they reheat them perfectly so they're crispy, and their special late-night menu items are creative and delicious."
Exceptional sauce-making technique,2024-09-30,5,"You can tell their sauce is made with properly hand-crushed tomatoes - it has that perfect texture with small chunks rather than being completely smooth. The bright flavor suggests minimal cooking, allowing the tomato quality to shine."
Toppings slide right off,2024-06-10,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Excellent beer pairing suggestions,2024-10-22,5,"Not only is their pizza excellent (try the fig and prosciutto!), but the staff is knowledgeable about their craft beer selection and can suggest the perfect pairing for whatever pizza you order."
Perfect pepperoni placement,2023-06-12,5,"As a pepperoni perfectionist, I appreciate that they space the pepperoni so every bite gets one full piece. No bare spots or clumped areas. Shows attention to detail that elevates the whole experience."
Too much garlic,2023-05-24,3,"I love garlic but this was excessive - felt like they mistook cloves for teaspoons in the recipe. My breath was lethal afterward, and the powerful flavor overwhelmed the other ingredients."
Burned bottom raw top,2025-03-23,1,The bottom of the crust was completely black while the cheese on top wasn't fully melted. This temperature imbalance suggests serious issues with their oven management and pizza-making technique.
Amazing Detroit-style,2024-07-22,5,"Their Detroit-style square pizza is incredible - crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior, and those corner pieces are to die for! The pepperoni cup and char perfectly. Worth the 30-minute wait."
Lackluster veggie options,2023-06-24,3,"Their vegetable toppings lacked freshness and flavor - the mushrooms were clearly canned, the peppers were soft and faded, and the onions were sparse. Disappointing for a place that advertises farm-fresh ingredients."
No flavor distinction,2024-11-01,3,Ordered two completely different specialty pizzas but they somehow tasted nearly identical. It's like they use the same base for everything and the toppings don't impart enough distinctive character.
Burned mouth on first bite,2024-04-13,2,"They served the pizza dangerously hot - barely out of the oven with no time to cool. Severely burned the roof of my mouth on the first bite, which ruined the rest of the meal and my next few days."
Ideal char-to-chew ratio,2024-12-23,5,The small charred bubbles on the crust add amazing flavor without dominating. They've mastered that balance between the slight bitterness of char and the natural sweetness of the dough. Technical perfection!
Excellent attention to cooking time,2025-05-19,5,They nail the cooking time perfectly - pulling the pizza from the oven at exactly the right moment when the cheese is fully melted and bubbling but not yet browned. Shows expertise and attention to detail.
Unmelted cheese in the center,2023-03-02,2,"The edges were fine but the center had cold, unmelted cheese - a sign the oven wasn't hot enough or the pizza wasn't cooked long enough. Basic pizza fundamentals seem to be lacking."
Perfect crunch factor,2024-03-05,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."
Sauce like ketchup,2025-04-06,2,"The sauce was suspiciously sweet and one-dimensional, reminiscent of ketchup rather than a proper pizza sauce. No evidence of herbs, garlic, or any complexity. Ruined what otherwise could have been a decent pizza."
Amazing Detroit-style,2024-10-07,5,"Their Detroit-style square pizza is incredible - crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior, and those corner pieces are to die for! The pepperoni cup and char perfectly. Worth the 30-minute wait."
Overpriced for what you get,2024-03-31,3,"$24 for a medium pizza with just two toppings seems excessive. The ingredients were fresh and the crust was good, but nothing justified the premium price. There are better values elsewhere in town."
Bland sauce needs work,2023-08-23,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
New owners ruined it,2023-07-28,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."
Greasy and disappointing,2023-09-02,2,"I had high hopes based on the reviews, but my pizza was swimming in grease. The crust was undercooked in the center, and the promised 'fresh vegetables' looked and tasted canned. Such a letdown."
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2023-04-15,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
Refrigerated dough taste,2023-03-05,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."
Crust like cardboard,2023-07-06,2,"The crust had all the flavor and texture of packing material - dry, tough, and completely devoid of character. Even the decent toppings couldn't save it. The foundation of good pizza is good dough, and this wasn't it."
Innovative toppings,2023-11-19,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."
Expert-level pizza folding,2024-07-22,5,Their thin-crust slices fold perfectly New York-style without cracking or losing toppings. The slight resistance before the fold is exactly what you want - showing the perfect balance of crisp and chew.
Undercooked in the middle,2023-02-03,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."
Perfect for dietary restrictions,2023-08-17,5,"As someone with multiple food allergies, I appreciate that they take dietary concerns seriously. Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"
Overpriced for what you get,2023-08-13,3,"$24 for a medium pizza with just two toppings seems excessive. The ingredients were fresh and the crust was good, but nothing justified the premium price. There are better values elsewhere in town."
Excellent wine pairings,2023-01-24,5,"Their curated wine list is designed specifically to pair with their pizzas, and the staff is knowledgeable about suggesting the perfect match. The house red with their sausage pizza is a transcendent combination."
Late night savior,2023-10-26,4,"Open until 2am on weekends, this place has saved me many times after a night out. Their slices are huge, reheated perfectly crisp, and they have creative toppings that hit the spot when you're hungry late at night."
Sauce like ketchup,2023-01-23,2,"The sauce was suspiciously sweet and one-dimensional, reminiscent of ketchup rather than a proper pizza sauce. No evidence of herbs, garlic, or any complexity. Ruined what otherwise could have been a decent pizza."
Excellent customer service,2024-12-28,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
Inconsistent quality,2024-11-27,3,I've been here three times. First visit: amazing. Second: terrible. Third: just okay. Seems like it really depends on who's working that day. Wish they could maintain better quality control.
Family night favorite,2024-09-23,5,"We bring our kids here every Friday night. The staff always make them feel special, providing dough for them to play with while we wait. Their kid-sized pizzas are perfect, and the parents love the craft beer selection."
Burnt crust ruins it,2023-10-06,2,"They claim 'char' is part of the Neapolitan experience, but there's a difference between char and burnt. The entire bottom of my pizza was black and bitter. Scraping it off meant losing half the crust."
All style no substance,2023-09-06,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."
Family night favorite,2023-08-21,5,"We bring our kids here every Friday night. The staff always make them feel special, providing dough for them to play with while we wait. Their kid-sized pizzas are perfect, and the parents love the craft beer selection."
Best pizza in town,2024-11-21,5,"The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Their signature pepperoni pizza had the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, and the pepperoni curled up into little cups of deliciousness. Will definitely be back!"
Masterful use of olive oil,2024-05-26,5,"The drizzle of high-quality olive oil they add just before serving makes all the difference - adds richness, enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, and adds a wonderful aromatic element. Simple but transformative."
Burned mouth on first bite,2023-12-19,2,"They served the pizza dangerously hot - barely out of the oven with no time to cool. Severely burned the roof of my mouth on the first bite, which ruined the rest of the meal and my next few days."
Too much garlic,2023-02-11,3,"I love garlic but this was excessive - felt like they mistook cloves for teaspoons in the recipe. My breath was lethal afterward, and the powerful flavor overwhelmed the other ingredients."
Excellent customer service,2024-08-11,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
Excellent Chicago deep dish,2025-06-27,5,"Hard to find authentic Chicago-style pizza in this area, but they nail it. The buttery, flaky crust, the layering of cheese under the sauce, the chunky tomato topping - all perfect. Worth the 45-minute cook time."
Best Hawaiian in the city,2023-04-07,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."
Innovative flavor combinations,2025-03-25,5,"Their 'Avant Garde' menu section features combinations I would never have thought of but somehow work perfectly. The pear, gorgonzola, walnut, and honey pizza was a revelation of sweet, salty, and savory harmony."
Pizza arrived upside-down,2023-02-13,1,Delivery driver must have taken a sharp turn because our pizza arrived completely flipped over in the box - all toppings stuck to the lid. Restaurant offered no solution other than suggesting we 'scrape it off and reassemble it.'
Crispy yet chewy perfection,2024-05-08,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."
Too much cheese,2025-02-03,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Skimpy on toppings,2025-04-09,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."
Perfect for kids' parties,2024-01-19,5,"Hosted my son's birthday here and it was fantastic. They did a dough-tossing demonstration for the kids, let them make their own mini pizzas, and the staff was incredibly patient and kind."
Too expensive for pizza,2024-09-29,3,"The pizza is good, I'll give them that. But $30 for a basic large cheese pizza is highway robbery. Add toppings and you're looking at $40-50. The quality doesn't justify these premium prices."
Perfectly crispy crust,2024-10-23,5,"However they achieve it, their crust has the perfect crispness all the way through - no soggy middle! Even the slices with lots of toppings maintain their structural integrity. Engineering marvel of pizza."
False advertising on size,2024-02-02,2,"Their menu clearly states that a large pizza is 16 inches, but what we received couldn't have been more than 14 inches. When questioned, they claimed their menu was outdated but refused any adjustment."
Righteous ranch drizzle,2023-11-02,5,Their house-made ranch drizzle takes their pizzas to another level. It's not your typical ranch - has hints of dill and garlic with a perfect consistency that adds creaminess without making things soggy.
Not worth the wait,2024-03-08,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."
Righteous ranch drizzle,2024-09-01,5,Their house-made ranch drizzle takes their pizzas to another level. It's not your typical ranch - has hints of dill and garlic with a perfect consistency that adds creaminess without making things soggy.
Perfect for lunch specials,2024-02-02,4,"Their lunch deal is unbeatable - $10 for a 10-inch pizza and small salad. The pizza comes out quickly, is always fresh, and the perfect size for one person. Great place for a work lunch."
Innovative toppings,2023-05-30,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."
Tasteless cheese substitute,2023-07-20,2,"Their vegan cheese option was terrible - had no meltability, a grainy texture, and tasted strongly of coconut which clashed with the tomato sauce. If you can't do vegan cheese well, better to offer cheese-free options that are properly balanced."
Perfect balance of flavors,2024-02-25,5,"Their 'Mediterranean' pizza has the perfect balance of flavors - the briny olives, tangy feta, fresh tomatoes, and herb-infused olive oil all complement each other without any one element overwhelming the others."
Excellent beer pairing suggestions,2023-05-20,5,"Not only is their pizza excellent (try the fig and prosciutto!), but the staff is knowledgeable about their craft beer selection and can suggest the perfect pairing for whatever pizza you order."
Perfect NY-style slices,2024-03-09,5,"As a transplant from NYC, I've been searching for authentic NY-style pizza. This place nails it - thin, foldable slices with the right amount of chew and grease. Their plain cheese slice is perfection."
Weird aftertaste,2025-04-03,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."
Ideal char-to-chew ratio,2024-04-17,5,The small charred bubbles on the crust add amazing flavor without dominating. They've mastered that balance between the slight bitterness of char and the natural sweetness of the dough. Technical perfection!
Perfect for large parties,2025-05-07,5,"Their party package is fantastic - multiple 18-inch pizzas with varied toppings, plenty of sides, and they were accommodating with our group of 20. Everything arrived hot and on time, and they included all the necessary paper goods."
Perfect for late-night cravings,2023-11-06,5,"Open until 3am on weekends, this place has saved many late nights. The slices are huge, they reheat them perfectly so they're crispy, and their special late-night menu items are creative and delicious."
Supreme quality control,2023-07-11,5,"Visited multiple times and the consistency is impressive - every pizza comes out identical to the last one, with the same excellent quality. Shows serious commitment to training and standards that's rare in casual dining."
Outstanding variety of options,2023-07-23,5,"Their menu has something for everyone - traditional options done well, creative specialties, and customizable choices. Even have dessert pizzas that are surprisingly good (try the Nutella and banana!)."
New owners ruined it,2025-05-02,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."
Perfect for picky eaters,2024-06-30,4,Their 'build your own quarter' option is genius - a large pizza divided into quadrants with different toppings. Perfect for our family where everyone wants something different. No more ordering multiple pizzas!
Excellence in simplicity,2023-05-24,5,"Their classic Margherita showcases their commitment to quality - the balance of sweet-acidic tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella, fragrant basil, and that perfectly chewy-crisp crust. Proof that simple can be sublime."
Inconsistent quality,2023-05-25,3,I've been here three times. First visit: amazing. Second: terrible. Third: just okay. Seems like it really depends on who's working that day. Wish they could maintain better quality control.
Authentic coal-fired perfection,2023-03-21,5,Their coal-fired oven gives the pizza a distinctive char and smoky flavor that's impossible to replicate any other way. The slight bitterness of the charred spots perfectly balances the sweetness of the sauce.
Excellent beer pairing suggestions,2023-07-23,5,"Not only is their pizza excellent (try the fig and prosciutto!), but the staff is knowledgeable about their craft beer selection and can suggest the perfect pairing for whatever pizza you order."
Terrible delivery experience,2025-05-02,1,"Ordered for Valentine's Day and regretted it. Pizza took 2 hours to arrive, was cold, and had the wrong toppings. Called the restaurant and they seemed completely unconcerned. Never again."
Late night savior,2025-01-13,4,"Open until 2am on weekends, this place has saved me many times after a night out. Their slices are huge, reheated perfectly crisp, and they have creative toppings that hit the spot when you're hungry late at night."
Perfect buffalo mozzarella application,2024-05-11,5,They understand that buffalo mozzarella shouldn't be cooked too long or it loses its distinctive texture and flavor. Applied in dollops after the pizza is mostly baked so it just barely melts while maintaining its creamy integrity. Technical perfection!

Expert-level pizza folding,2023-11-08,5,Their thin-crust slices fold perfectly New York-style without cracking or losing toppings. The slight resistance before the fold is exactly what you want - showing the perfect balance of crisp and chew.
Tomato sauce tasted rancid,2025-06-27,1,"The sauce had a distinctly off flavor that suggested the tomatoes had gone bad before processing. After two bites, couldn't continue eating as the rancid notes became more pronounced. Basic food safety seems questionable."
Way too much crust,2023-08-06,2,The edge crust (cornicione) was comically large - almost half of each slice was just bread with no toppings. This ratio of crust to actual pizza was way off and made for a disappointing experience.
Pizza barely survived the drive home,2023-11-28,2,"Ordered takeout and by the time I got home (15 minutes), the pizza was a soggy mess. They clearly don't use appropriate packaging for takeout - no vents to release steam means the crust steams itself into sogginess."
Hidden gem for vegans,2024-12-01,5,"I can't believe how good their vegan pizza is! They make their own cashew cheese that actually melts properly, and their vegetable toppings are always fresh and seasonal. Even my non-vegan friends love it."
Magnificent flavor layering,2024-03-24,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Best Hawaiian in the city,2024-01-28,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."
Ideal char-to-chew ratio,2023-07-21,5,The small charred bubbles on the crust add amazing flavor without dominating. They've mastered that balance between the slight bitterness of char and the natural sweetness of the dough. Technical perfection!
Perfect buffalo mozzarella application,2023-01-13,5,They understand that buffalo mozzarella shouldn't be cooked too long or it loses its distinctive texture and flavor. Applied in dollops after the pizza is mostly baked so it just barely melts while maintaining its creamy integrity. Technical perfection!
Way too much crust,2024-06-03,2,The edge crust (cornicione) was comically large - almost half of each slice was just bread with no toppings. This ratio of crust to actual pizza was way off and made for a disappointing experience.
Cold center burnt edges,2025-01-14,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Too much salt in the dough,2024-06-11,2,The crust was so salty it was almost inedible - overwhelmed all the other flavors and left me incredibly thirsty afterward. A heavy hand with salt ruined what could have been a good pizza.
Way too much crust,2024-05-17,2,The edge crust (cornicione) was comically large - almost half of each slice was just bread with no toppings. This ratio of crust to actual pizza was way off and made for a disappointing experience.
Way too much oregano,2023-12-03,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
Masterclass in proper baking,2023-06-20,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
Greasy and disappointing,2024-09-08,2,"I had high hopes based on the reviews, but my pizza was swimming in grease. The crust was undercooked in the center, and the promised 'fresh vegetables' looked and tasted canned. Such a letdown."
Greasy and disappointing,2024-01-23,2,"I had high hopes based on the reviews, but my pizza was swimming in grease. The crust was undercooked in the center, and the promised 'fresh vegetables' looked and tasted canned. Such a letdown."
Innovative toppings,2024-01-22,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2023-01-28,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
Incredible vodka sauce base,2023-09-30,5,"Their vodka sauce pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil is something special. The creamy, slightly spicy sauce is a perfect alternative to traditional tomato sauce. Add prosciutto for an extra flavor dimension!"
Too expensive for pizza,2023-05-14,3,"The pizza is good, I'll give them that. But $30 for a basic large cheese pizza is highway robbery. Add toppings and you're looking at $40-50. The quality doesn't justify these premium prices."
Family night favorite,2023-05-23,5,"We bring our kids here every Friday night. The staff always make them feel special, providing dough for them to play with while we wait. Their kid-sized pizzas are perfect, and the parents love the craft beer selection."
Too much salt in the dough,2023-11-24,2,The crust was so salty it was almost inedible - overwhelmed all the other flavors and left me incredibly thirsty afterward. A heavy hand with salt ruined what could have been a good pizza.
Crust like cardboard,2024-07-22,2,"The crust had all the flavor and texture of packing material - dry, tough, and completely devoid of character. Even the decent toppings couldn't save it. The foundation of good pizza is good dough, and this wasn't it."
Masterclass in proper baking,2024-02-21,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
Brilliant use of fermented dough,2024-11-04,5,Their 72-hour fermented dough has incredible depth of flavor with subtle sourdough notes. The extended fermentation creates a complex web of flavors and perfect texture that you simply can't achieve with quick-rise methods.
Too expensive for pizza,2023-04-15,3,"The pizza is good, I'll give them that. But $30 for a basic large cheese pizza is highway robbery. Add toppings and you're looking at $40-50. The quality doesn't justify these premium prices."
Crispy yet chewy perfection,2024-09-16,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."
Tough leathery crust,2025-06-16,2,"The crust was so tough I almost couldn't bite through it - like trying to eat leather. The edges were particularly problematic, had to tear pieces off with significant effort. Completely lacks the pleasant chewiness good pizza should have."
Superior ingredients make the difference,2025-06-20,5,"They import their flour from Italy, use San Marzano tomatoes, and make their mozzarella in-house daily. The commitment to quality ingredients is evident in every bite - nothing is an afterthought."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2024-03-31,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Perfect for dietary restrictions,2025-05-28,5,"As someone with multiple food allergies, I appreciate that they take dietary concerns seriously. Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"
Not worth the wait,2024-09-19,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."
Too salty,2023-09-23,2,"Everything I tried was oversalted - the crust, the sauce, and especially the cheese. It was like they were trying to ensure you'd order more drinks. Couldn't finish my pizza and was thirsty all night."
Authentic Italian experience,2023-09-22,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
Outstanding breakfast pizza,2023-11-24,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2023-12-31,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
Authentic Italian experience,2023-11-08,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
Creative seasonal specials,2023-01-01,5,"Just had their spring special with asparagus, lemon ricotta, and prosciutto. The combination was bright, fresh, and perfect for the season. Love that they use local, seasonal ingredients."
Innovative toppings,2024-07-25,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."
Expert-level pizza folding,2025-05-18,5,Their thin-crust slices fold perfectly New York-style without cracking or losing toppings. The slight resistance before the fold is exactly what you want - showing the perfect balance of crisp and chew.
Perfect crust-to-topping ratio,2023-04-14,5,"Some places overload toppings so the crust gets soggy, others are too sparse. This place gets it perfect - enough toppings to get some in every bite, but not so much that the structural integrity is compromised."
Weird aftertaste,2024-05-01,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."
Burned mouth on first bite,2023-01-15,2,"They served the pizza dangerously hot - barely out of the oven with no time to cool. Severely burned the roof of my mouth on the first bite, which ruined the rest of the meal and my next few days."
Innovative flavor combinations,2024-05-10,5,"Their 'Avant Garde' menu section features combinations I would never have thought of but somehow work perfectly. The pear, gorgonzola, walnut, and honey pizza was a revelation of sweet, salty, and savory harmony."
Inconsistent quality,2024-04-30,3,I've been here three times. First visit: amazing. Second: terrible. Third: just okay. Seems like it really depends on who's working that day. Wish they could maintain better quality control.
Dirty restaurant,2023-08-18,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."
Perfect for lunch specials,2024-08-06,4,"Their lunch deal is unbeatable - $10 for a 10-inch pizza and small salad. The pizza comes out quickly, is always fresh, and the perfect size for one person. Great place for a work lunch."
Authentic coal-fired perfection,2023-10-04,5,Their coal-fired oven gives the pizza a distinctive char and smoky flavor that's impossible to replicate any other way. The slight bitterness of the charred spots perfectly balances the sweetness of the sauce.
Perfect pepperoni placement,2025-02-27,5,"As a pepperoni perfectionist, I appreciate that they space the pepperoni so every bite gets one full piece. No bare spots or clumped areas. Shows attention to detail that elevates the whole experience."
Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2024-01-21,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies. The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."
Perfect ingredient distribution,2024-10-07,5,"Every bite had the perfect combination of ingredients - no barren spots, no overwhelming clumps. The toppings were distributed with such precision it almost seemed measured. The mark of true professionals!"
Bland sauce needs work,2023-03-29,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
Brilliant use of fermented dough,2024-05-22,5,Their 72-hour fermented dough has incredible depth of flavor with subtle sourdough notes. The extended fermentation creates a complex web of flavors and perfect texture that you simply can't achieve with quick-rise methods.
Stale-tasting crust,2023-06-05,2,"The crust had a stale, almost cardboard-like quality that suggests either old dough or old flour. Fresh ingredients on top couldn't compensate for the foundation being off."
Unmelted cheese in the center,2023-03-14,2,"The edges were fine but the center had cold, unmelted cheese - a sign the oven wasn't hot enough or the pizza wasn't cooked long enough. Basic pizza fundamentals seem to be lacking."
Family night favorite,2023-07-25,5,"We bring our kids here every Friday night. The staff always make them feel special, providing dough for them to play with while we wait. Their kid-sized pizzas are perfect, and the parents love the craft beer selection."
Too much cheese,2024-05-24,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Amazing Detroit-style,2023-11-21,5,"Their Detroit-style square pizza is incredible - crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior, and those corner pieces are to die for! The pepperoni cup and char perfectly. Worth the 30-minute wait."
Innovative toppings,2024-06-23,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."
Dirty restaurant,2024-04-06,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2024-05-07,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."
Crispy yet chewy perfection,2023-02-11,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."
Tasteless cheese substitute,2025-03-28,2,"Their vegan cheese option was terrible - had no meltability, a grainy texture, and tasted strongly of coconut which clashed with the tomato sauce. If you can't do vegan cheese well, better to offer cheese-free options that are properly balanced."
Perfect ingredient distribution,2025-05-07,5,"Every bite had the perfect combination of ingredients - no barren spots, no overwhelming clumps. The toppings were distributed with such precision it almost seemed measured. The mark of true professionals!"
Authentic Italian experience,2025-05-03,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
Supreme quality control,2024-12-18,5,"Visited multiple times and the consistency is impressive - every pizza comes out identical to the last one, with the same excellent quality. Shows serious commitment to training and standards that's rare in casual dining."
Too greasy to enjoy,2024-02-16,2,"Had to literally blot my pizza with napkins, which came away completely saturated with grease. Whatever flavor might have been there was drowned in oil. Couldn't finish it as it was making me feel ill."
Not worth the wait,2023-07-03,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."
Family night favorite,2023-02-10,5,"We bring our kids here every Friday night. The staff always make them feel special, providing dough for them to play with while we wait. Their kid-sized pizzas are perfect, and the parents love the craft beer selection."
Authentic coal-fired perfection,2025-02-09,5,Their coal-fired oven gives the pizza a distinctive char and smoky flavor that's impossible to replicate any other way. The slight bitterness of the charred spots perfectly balances the sweetness of the sauce.
Tomato sauce tasted rancid,2024-08-16,1,"The sauce had a distinctly off flavor that suggested the tomatoes had gone bad before processing. After two bites, couldn't continue eating as the rancid notes became more pronounced. Basic food safety seems questionable."
Perfect pepperoni placement,2023-05-28,5,"As a pepperoni perfectionist, I appreciate that they space the pepperoni so every bite gets one full piece. No bare spots or clumped areas. Shows attention to detail that elevates the whole experience."
Too much cornmeal,2024-09-14,3,"They use cornmeal on the bottom of the crust to prevent sticking, which is standard, but they use so much that it's like eating pizza on a sandpaper surface. Gritty texture overwhelms the experience."
Outstanding breakfast pizza,2024-05-27,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
Burned mouth on first bite,2024-09-10,2,"They served the pizza dangerously hot - barely out of the oven with no time to cool. Severely burned the roof of my mouth on the first bite, which ruined the rest of the meal and my next few days."
Exceptional sauce-making technique,2023-07-08,5,"You can tell their sauce is made with properly hand-crushed tomatoes - it has that perfect texture with small chunks rather than being completely smooth. The bright flavor suggests minimal cooking, allowing the tomato quality to shine."
Burned bottom raw top,2024-07-13,1,The bottom of the crust was completely black while the cheese on top wasn't fully melted. This temperature imbalance suggests serious issues with their oven management and pizza-making technique.
Perfect textural contrast,2025-04-11,5,"The contrast between the crisp bottom, the tender interior crumb, the gooey cheese, and the slight resistance of the toppings creates a textural symphony. Each bite is interesting and satisfying in a different way."
Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2024-09-09,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies. The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."
Tiny portion sizes,2024-03-02,2,"Their 'personal' pizza is the size of a CD. For $15, I expected something that would actually satisfy my hunger. Had to order a second one, turning a quick lunch into an expensive disappointment."
No flavor distinction,2024-04-06,3,Ordered two completely different specialty pizzas but they somehow tasted nearly identical. It's like they use the same base for everything and the toppings don't impart enough distinctive character.
Best pizza in town,2023-11-01,5,"The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Their signature pepperoni pizza had the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, and the pepperoni curled up into little cups of deliciousness. Will definitely be back!"
Rude staff ruined the meal,2023-07-06,2,"The pizza itself was decent, but the counter staff was incredibly rude - sighing when I asked questions about ingredients, rushing my order, and actually rolling their eyes when I requested extra napkins."
All style no substance,2025-04-14,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."
Excellent attention to cooking time,2023-12-13,5,They nail the cooking time perfectly - pulling the pizza from the oven at exactly the right moment when the cheese is fully melted and bubbling but not yet browned. Shows expertise and attention to detail.
Inconsistent quality,2024-12-21,3,I've been here three times. First visit: amazing. Second: terrible. Third: just okay. Seems like it really depends on who's working that day. Wish they could maintain better quality control.
Overpriced for what you get,2024-06-03,3,"$24 for a medium pizza with just two toppings seems excessive. The ingredients were fresh and the crust was good, but nothing justified the premium price. There are better values elsewhere in town."
Superior ingredients make the difference,2025-01-04,5,"They import their flour from Italy, use San Marzano tomatoes, and make their mozzarella in-house daily. The commitment to quality ingredients is evident in every bite - nothing is an afterthought."
Weird aftertaste,2024-02-13,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."
Perfect thin crust,2024-02-24,5,"If you're a thin crust fan, this is your place. Cracker-thin, crispy all the way through, yet somehow still has a nice chew. Their simple cheese pizza showcases their excellent sauce - slightly sweet with a nice herb blend."
Overpriced for what you get,2023-08-15,3,"$24 for a medium pizza with just two toppings seems excessive. The ingredients were fresh and the crust was good, but nothing justified the premium price. There are better values elsewhere in town."

Too noisy for conversation,2025-03-07,3,The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option.
Too much sauce,2025-04-07,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Skimpy on toppings,2023-04-07,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."
Tough leathery crust,2023-03-23,2,"The crust was so tough I almost couldn't bite through it - like trying to eat leather. The edges were particularly problematic, had to tear pieces off with significant effort. Completely lacks the pleasant chewiness good pizza should have."

Crust like cardboard,2023-05-05,2,"The crust had all the flavor and texture of packing material - dry, tough, and completely devoid of character. Even the decent toppings couldn't save it. The foundation of good pizza is good dough, and this wasn't it."
Perfect temperature every time,2024-08-27,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2024-11-13,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies. The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."
Too much cheese,2025-04-26,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Perfect crust-to-topping ratio,2024-09-04,5,"Some places overload toppings so the crust gets soggy, others are too sparse. This place gets it perfect - enough toppings to get some in every bite, but not so much that the structural integrity is compromised."
Best white pizza ever,2023-05-09,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"
Way too much crust,2025-06-20,2,The edge crust (cornicione) was comically large - almost half of each slice was just bread with no toppings. This ratio of crust to actual pizza was way off and made for a disappointing experience.
Terrible delivery experience,2024-01-22,1,"Ordered for Valentine's Day and regretted it. Pizza took 2 hours to arrive, was cold, and had the wrong toppings. Called the restaurant and they seemed completely unconcerned. Never again."
Way too much oregano,2025-02-19,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
Creative seasonal specials,2024-12-23,5,"Just had their spring special with asparagus, lemon ricotta, and prosciutto. The combination was bright, fresh, and perfect for the season. Love that they use local, seasonal ingredients."
Rude staff ruined the meal,2023-05-25,2,"The pizza itself was decent, but the counter staff was incredibly rude - sighing when I asked questions about ingredients, rushing my order, and actually rolling their eyes when I requested extra napkins."
Authentic coal-fired perfection,2025-05-24,5,Their coal-fired oven gives the pizza a distinctive char and smoky flavor that's impossible to replicate any other way. The slight bitterness of the charred spots perfectly balances the sweetness of the sauce.
Tasteless cheese substitute,2023-07-31,2,"Their vegan cheese option was terrible - had no meltability, a grainy texture, and tasted strongly of coconut which clashed with the tomato sauce. If you can't do vegan cheese well, better to offer cheese-free options that are properly balanced."
Perfect for large parties,2025-02-06,5,"Their party package is fantastic - multiple 18-inch pizzas with varied toppings, plenty of sides, and they were accommodating with our group of 20. Everything arrived hot and on time, and they included all the necessary paper goods."
Cold center burnt edges,2023-01-11,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Sauce like ketchup,2025-05-06,2,"The sauce was suspiciously sweet and one-dimensional, reminiscent of ketchup rather than a proper pizza sauce. No evidence of herbs, garlic, or any complexity. Ruined what otherwise could have been a decent pizza."
Authentic Italian experience,2025-04-13,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
Greasy and disappointing,2025-05-24,2,"I had high hopes based on the reviews, but my pizza was swimming in grease. The crust was undercooked in the center, and the promised 'fresh vegetables' looked and tasted canned. Such a letdown."
Cold center burnt edges,2024-12-11,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Best Hawaiian in the city,2024-04-09,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."
Mediocre at best,2024-02-23,3,"Nothing terrible but nothing special either. The crust was okay, toppings were standard, and service was fine. It's the kind of place you go when you're in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip for."
Late night savior,2024-11-12,4,"Open until 2am on weekends, this place has saved me many times after a night out. Their slices are huge, reheated perfectly crisp, and they have creative toppings that hit the spot when you're hungry late at night."
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2024-03-06,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Brilliant seasonal rotation,2024-08-02,5,"Love that they have a rotating seasonal pizza that showcases what's fresh. The current spring offering with asparagus, green garlic, and fresh peas is bright and delicious - a perfect reflection of the season."
Pizza arrived upside-down,2025-06-25,1,Delivery driver must have taken a sharp turn because our pizza arrived completely flipped over in the box - all toppings stuck to the lid. Restaurant offered no solution other than suggesting we 'scrape it off and reassemble it.'
Disappointed with service,2023-02-17,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."
Perfectly crispy crust,2023-07-27,5,"However they achieve it, their crust has the perfect crispness all the way through - no soggy middle! Even the slices with lots of toppings maintain their structural integrity. Engineering marvel of pizza."
Creative seasonal specials,2024-04-03,5,"Just had their spring special with asparagus, lemon ricotta, and prosciutto. The combination was bright, fresh, and perfect for the season. Love that they use local, seasonal ingredients."
Too much cornmeal,2023-06-02,3,"They use cornmeal on the bottom of the crust to prevent sticking, which is standard, but they use so much that it's like eating pizza on a sandpaper surface. Gritty texture overwhelms the experience."
Tomato sauce tasted rancid,2024-03-14,1,"The sauce had a distinctly off flavor that suggested the tomatoes had gone bad before processing. After two bites, couldn't continue eating as the rancid notes became more pronounced. Basic food safety seems questionable."
Bland sauce needs work,2023-01-04,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
False advertising on size,2023-10-12,2,"Their menu clearly states that a large pizza is 16 inches, but what we received couldn't have been more than 14 inches. When questioned, they claimed their menu was outdated but refused any adjustment."
Perfect for kids' parties,2025-04-20,5,"Hosted my son's birthday here and it was fantastic. They did a dough-tossing demonstration for the kids, let them make their own mini pizzas, and the staff was incredibly patient and kind."

Too salty,2025-03-21,2,"Everything I tried was oversalted - the crust, the sauce, and especially the cheese. It was like they were trying to ensure you'd order more drinks. Couldn't finish my pizza and was thirsty all night."
Excellence in simplicity,2023-08-08,5,"Their classic Margherita showcases their commitment to quality - the balance of sweet-acidic tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella, fragrant basil, and that perfectly chewy-crisp crust. Proof that simple can be sublime."
Perfect for kids' parties,2024-12-04,5,"Hosted my son's birthday here and it was fantastic. They did a dough-tossing demonstration for the kids, let them make their own mini pizzas, and the staff was incredibly patient and kind."
Magnificent flavor layering,2024-05-05,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Too much emphasis on appearance,2025-03-24,3,"The pizza was clearly designed to look good in photos - perfect symmetry, vibrant colors, photogenic cheese pull - but the flavor was underwhelming. Style over substance for the Instagram crowd."
No flavor distinction,2023-05-18,3,Ordered two completely different specialty pizzas but they somehow tasted nearly identical. It's like they use the same base for everything and the toppings don't impart enough distinctive character.
Cold center burnt edges,2025-03-28,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Sauce like ketchup,2024-01-13,2,"The sauce was suspiciously sweet and one-dimensional, reminiscent of ketchup rather than a proper pizza sauce. No evidence of herbs, garlic, or any complexity. Ruined what otherwise could have been a decent pizza."
Supreme quality control,2023-10-19,5,"Visited multiple times and the consistency is impressive - every pizza comes out identical to the last one, with the same excellent quality. Shows serious commitment to training and standards that's rare in casual dining."
Supreme quality control,2024-07-11,5,"Visited multiple times and the consistency is impressive - every pizza comes out identical to the last one, with the same excellent quality. Shows serious commitment to training and standards that's rare in casual dining."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2024-06-21,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Cold center burnt edges,2024-11-23,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Mediocre at best,2024-10-28,3,"Nothing terrible but nothing special either. The crust was okay, toppings were standard, and service was fine. It's the kind of place you go when you're in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip for."
Perfect crust-to-topping ratio,2025-03-08,5,"Some places overload toppings so the crust gets soggy, others are too sparse. This place gets it perfect - enough toppings to get some in every bite, but not so much that the structural integrity is compromised."
Toppings slide right off,2023-03-30,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Perfect balance of flavors,2023-01-12,5,"Their 'Mediterranean' pizza has the perfect balance of flavors - the briny olives, tangy feta, fresh tomatoes, and herb-infused olive oil all complement each other without any one element overwhelming the others."
Too much cheese,2025-01-11,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Supreme quality control,2024-09-30,5,"Visited multiple times and the consistency is impressive - every pizza comes out identical to the last one, with the same excellent quality. Shows serious commitment to training and standards that's rare in casual dining."
Outstanding variety of options,2023-06-13,5,"Their menu has something for everyone - traditional options done well, creative specialties, and customizable choices. Even have dessert pizzas that are surprisingly good (try the Nutella and banana!)."
Painfully obvious cheap ingredients,2024-08-28,2,"The pre-shredded cheese didn't melt properly, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the sausage had that distinctive processed flavor. At these prices, cutting corners on ingredients is inexcusable."
Incredible vodka sauce base,2024-07-26,5,"Their vodka sauce pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil is something special. The creamy, slightly spicy sauce is a perfect alternative to traditional tomato sauce. Add prosciutto for an extra flavor dimension!"
Crispy yet chewy perfection,2023-10-21,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."
Supreme quality control,2025-02-18,5,"Visited multiple times and the consistency is impressive - every pizza comes out identical to the last one, with the same excellent quality. Shows serious commitment to training and standards that's rare in casual dining."
Brilliant use of fermented dough,2024-06-06,5,Their 72-hour fermented dough has incredible depth of flavor with subtle sourdough notes. The extended fermentation creates a complex web of flavors and perfect texture that you simply can't achieve with quick-rise methods.
Perfect temperature every time,2024-04-16,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
Outstanding variety of options,2023-07-06,5,"Their menu has something for everyone - traditional options done well, creative specialties, and customizable choices. Even have dessert pizzas that are surprisingly good (try the Nutella and banana!)."
Inconsistent quality,2023-02-11,3,I've been here three times. First visit: amazing. Second: terrible. Third: just okay. Seems like it really depends on who's working that day. Wish they could maintain better quality control.
Pizza arrived upside-down,2024-07-18,1,Delivery driver must have taken a sharp turn because our pizza arrived completely flipped over in the box - all toppings stuck to the lid. Restaurant offered no solution other than suggesting we 'scrape it off and reassemble it.'
Toppings slide right off,2025-03-23,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Absurdly small slices,2024-10-17,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."
Perfect pepperoni placement,2023-03-06,5,"As a pepperoni perfectionist, I appreciate that they space the pepperoni so every bite gets one full piece. No bare spots or clumped areas. Shows attention to detail that elevates the whole experience."
Perfect temperature every time,2023-07-16,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
Doughy and undercooked,2024-06-26,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Unmelted cheese in the center,2024-03-04,2,"The edges were fine but the center had cold, unmelted cheese - a sign the oven wasn't hot enough or the pizza wasn't cooked long enough. Basic pizza fundamentals seem to be lacking."
Too much cheese,2025-05-02,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Perfect for kids' parties,2023-05-19,5,"Hosted my son's birthday here and it was fantastic. They did a dough-tossing demonstration for the kids, let them make their own mini pizzas, and the staff was incredibly patient and kind."
Cold center burnt edges,2025-03-31,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Innovative toppings,2025-01-13,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."
Cheese solidified too quickly,2025-01-10,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Outstanding variety of options,2023-05-24,5,"Their menu has something for everyone - traditional options done well, creative specialties, and customizable choices. Even have dessert pizzas that are surprisingly good (try the Nutella and banana!)."
Perfect temperature every time,2025-06-21,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
Outstanding wood-fired perfection,2023-11-27,5,The wood-fired oven gives their pizza a distinctive smoky complexity you can't get any other way. The slight char adds bitterness that balances the sweetness of the sauce perfectly. Worth seeking out for this unique flavor profile.
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2023-10-19,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Perfect crust-to-topping ratio,2025-06-30,5,"Some places overload toppings so the crust gets soggy, others are too sparse. This place gets it perfect - enough toppings to get some in every bite, but not so much that the structural integrity is compromised."
Excellence in simplicity,2024-10-15,5,"Their classic Margherita showcases their commitment to quality - the balance of sweet-acidic tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella, fragrant basil, and that perfectly chewy-crisp crust. Proof that simple can be sublime."
Epic meat lovers option,2025-03-22,4,"If you're a carnivore, their 'Butcher's Block' pizza is incredible. Five different meats, all high quality - the soppressata and house-made sausage are standouts. Just be ready for a food coma afterward!"
Refrigerated dough taste,2023-07-27,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."
Ideal char-to-chew ratio,2023-09-02,5,The small charred bubbles on the crust add amazing flavor without dominating. They've mastered that balance between the slight bitterness of char and the natural sweetness of the dough. Technical perfection!
Greasy and disappointing,2025-04-07,2,"I had high hopes based on the reviews, but my pizza was swimming in grease. The crust was undercooked in the center, and the promised 'fresh vegetables' looked and tasted canned. Such a letdown."
Excellent wine pairings,2023-01-28,5,"Their curated wine list is designed specifically to pair with their pizzas, and the staff is knowledgeable about suggesting the perfect match. The house red with their sausage pizza is a transcendent combination."
Toppings slide right off,2024-10-21,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2023-08-16,5,They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2025-06-17,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
Doughy and undercooked,2024-08-28,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Way too much oregano,2025-04-29,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
Undercooked in the middle,2025-05-18,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."
Burnt crust ruins it,2023-06-05,2,"They claim 'char' is part of the Neapolitan experience, but there's a difference between char and burnt. The entire bottom of my pizza was black and bitter. Scraping it off meant losing half the crust."
Bland sauce needs work,2023-11-27,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
Tiny portion sizes,2023-01-12,2,"Their 'personal' pizza is the size of a CD. For $15, I expected something that would actually satisfy my hunger. Had to order a second one, turning a quick lunch into an expensive disappointment."
Lackluster veggie options,2023-03-06,3,"Their vegetable toppings lacked freshness and flavor - the mushrooms were clearly canned, the peppers were soft and faded, and the onions were sparse. Disappointing for a place that advertises farm-fresh ingredients."
Too noisy for conversation,2023-09-01,3,The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option.
False advertising on size,2024-09-18,2,"Their menu clearly states that a large pizza is 16 inches, but what we received couldn't have been more than 14 inches. When questioned, they claimed their menu was outdated but refused any adjustment."
Brilliant use of fermented dough,2024-12-16,5,Their 72-hour fermented dough has incredible depth of flavor with subtle sourdough notes. The extended fermentation creates a complex web of flavors and perfect texture that you simply can't achieve with quick-rise methods.
Too much cheese,2025-02-08,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Late night savior,2024-12-20,4,"Open until 2am on weekends, this place has saved me many times after a night out. Their slices are huge, reheated perfectly crisp, and they have creative toppings that hit the spot when you're hungry late at night."
Perfect crunch factor,2024-04-11,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."
Perfect NY-style slices,2025-04-21,5,"As a transplant from NYC, I've been searching for authentic NY-style pizza. This place nails it - thin, foldable slices with the right amount of chew and grease. Their plain cheese slice is perfection."
Excellent attention to cooking time,2024-09-22,5,They nail the cooking time perfectly - pulling the pizza from the oven at exactly the right moment when the cheese is fully melted and bubbling but not yet browned. Shows expertise and attention to detail.
Authentic Italian experience,2023-04-16,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
Bland sauce needs work,2025-01-31,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
Perfect for kids' parties,2023-07-08,5,"Hosted my son's birthday here and it was fantastic. They did a dough-tossing demonstration for the kids, let them make their own mini pizzas, and the staff was incredibly patient and kind."
Excessive grease pooling,2024-02-23,2,"Had to continuously blot the pizza with napkins as pools of orange grease formed on top of the cheese with every passing minute. By the end, the napkins were completely saturated and transparent. Felt unhealthy even by pizza standards."
Underwhelming and basic,2024-03-28,3,"Nothing particularly wrong with it, but nothing memorable either. Standard crust, standard sauce, standard toppings. In a city with so many pizza options, this place doesn't give you any reason to return."
Amazing Detroit-style,2023-09-09,5,"Their Detroit-style square pizza is incredible - crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior, and those corner pieces are to die for! The pepperoni cup and char perfectly. Worth the 30-minute wait."
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2024-06-29,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."
No-cheese option was all sauce,2023-08-08,2,"Ordered a cheese-free pizza for my dairy-allergic friend, but they made no adjustments - just removed the cheese and left a soggy sauce-covered bread. Good pizza without cheese requires rebalancing other elements."
Expert-level pizza folding,2024-09-02,5,Their thin-crust slices fold perfectly New York-style without cracking or losing toppings. The slight resistance before the fold is exactly what you want - showing the perfect balance of crisp and chew.
Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2025-03-21,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
Brilliant use of fermented dough,2023-07-03,5,Their 72-hour fermented dough has incredible depth of flavor with subtle sourdough notes. The extended fermentation creates a complex web of flavors and perfect texture that you simply can't achieve with quick-rise methods.
Perfectly crispy crust,2024-08-12,5,"However they achieve it, their crust has the perfect crispness all the way through - no soggy middle! Even the slices with lots of toppings maintain their structural integrity. Engineering marvel of pizza."
Excellent attention to cooking time,2023-12-28,5,They nail the cooking time perfectly - pulling the pizza from the oven at exactly the right moment when the cheese is fully melted and bubbling but not yet browned. Shows expertise and attention to detail.
Not worth the wait,2025-06-09,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."
Best pizza in town,2023-10-02,5,"The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Their signature pepperoni pizza had the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, and the pepperoni curled up into little cups of deliciousness. Will definitely be back!"
Perfect thin crust,2023-11-08,5,"If you're a thin crust fan, this is your place. Cracker-thin, crispy all the way through, yet somehow still has a nice chew. Their simple cheese pizza showcases their excellent sauce - slightly sweet with a nice herb blend."
Perfect for late-night cravings,2023-12-16,5,"Open until 3am on weekends, this place has saved many late nights. The slices are huge, they reheat them perfectly so they're crispy, and their special late-night menu items are creative and delicious."

Perfect for lunch specials,2023-10-04,4,"Their lunch deal is unbeatable - $10 for a 10-inch pizza and small salad. The pizza comes out quickly, is always fresh, and the perfect size for one person. Great place for a work lunch."
Tiny portion sizes,2023-03-31,2,"Their 'personal' pizza is the size of a CD. For $15, I expected something that would actually satisfy my hunger. Had to order a second one, turning a quick lunch into an expensive disappointment."

Greasy and disappointing,2023-12-06,2,"I had high hopes based on the reviews, but my pizza was swimming in grease. The crust was undercooked in the center, and the promised 'fresh vegetables' looked and tasted canned. Such a letdown."
Painfully obvious cheap ingredients,2024-07-13,2,"The pre-shredded cheese didn't melt properly, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the sausage had that distinctive processed flavor. At these prices, cutting corners on ingredients is inexcusable."
Terrible delivery experience,2024-11-03,1,"Ordered for Valentine's Day and regretted it. Pizza took 2 hours to arrive, was cold, and had the wrong toppings. Called the restaurant and they seemed completely unconcerned. Never again."
Sloppy presentation,2024-10-01,3,"The pizza looked like it had been assembled in a hurry - toppings haphazardly thrown on, cheese unevenly distributed, and the cutting was so uneven that some slices were twice the size of others. Taste was okay, but appearance matters too."
Too much salt in the dough,2024-08-01,2,The crust was so salty it was almost inedible - overwhelmed all the other flavors and left me incredibly thirsty afterward. A heavy hand with salt ruined what could have been a good pizza.
Doughy and undercooked,2024-08-02,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."

Perfectly crispy crust,2024-03-26,5,"However they achieve it, their crust has the perfect crispness all the way through - no soggy middle! Even the slices with lots of toppings maintain their structural integrity. Engineering marvel of pizza."
Too much emphasis on appearance,2024-10-17,3,"The pizza was clearly designed to look good in photos - perfect symmetry, vibrant colors, photogenic cheese pull - but the flavor was underwhelming. Style over substance for the Instagram crowd."
Burned bottom raw top,2024-04-28,1,The bottom of the crust was completely black while the cheese on top wasn't fully melted. This temperature imbalance suggests serious issues with their oven management and pizza-making technique.
False advertising on size,2025-05-24,2,"Their menu clearly states that a large pizza is 16 inches, but what we received couldn't have been more than 14 inches. When questioned, they claimed their menu was outdated but refused any adjustment."
Perfect textural contrast,2023-05-28,5,"The contrast between the crisp bottom, the tender interior crumb, the gooey cheese, and the slight resistance of the toppings creates a textural symphony. Each bite is interesting and satisfying in a different way."
Skimpy on toppings,2023-10-20,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."
Perfect pepperoni placement,2025-06-21,5,"As a pepperoni perfectionist, I appreciate that they space the pepperoni so every bite gets one full piece. No bare spots or clumped areas. Shows attention to detail that elevates the whole experience."
Too much cornmeal,2024-12-27,3,"They use cornmeal on the bottom of the crust to prevent sticking, which is standard, but they use so much that it's like eating pizza on a sandpaper surface. Gritty texture overwhelms the experience."
Great gluten-free option,2023-06-06,4,"As someone with celiac disease, finding good gluten-free pizza is a challenge. Their cauliflower crust was one of the best I've had - doesn't fall apart and has a nice flavor. Toppings were generous too."
Rude staff ruined the meal,2024-02-08,2,"The pizza itself was decent, but the counter staff was incredibly rude - sighing when I asked questions about ingredients, rushing my order, and actually rolling their eyes when I requested extra napkins."
Creative seasonal specials,2024-09-16,5,"Just had their spring special with asparagus, lemon ricotta, and prosciutto. The combination was bright, fresh, and perfect for the season. Love that they use local, seasonal ingredients."
Cheese solidified too quickly,2023-08-24,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Family night favorite,2025-05-14,5,"We bring our kids here every Friday night. The staff always make them feel special, providing dough for them to play with while we wait. Their kid-sized pizzas are perfect, and the parents love the craft beer selection."
Spicy special was too much,2024-02-04,2,Their 'Firebreather' pizza should come with a warning label. It wasn't enjoyably spicy - it was painfully hot to the point where I couldn't taste anything else. Had to throw most of it away.

Pizza arrived upside-down,2025-01-24,1,Delivery driver must have taken a sharp turn because our pizza arrived completely flipped over in the box - all toppings stuck to the lid. Restaurant offered no solution other than suggesting we 'scrape it off and reassemble it.'
False advertising on ingredients,2023-02-07,1,"Menu promised 'house-made Italian sausage' but what came on my pizza was clearly pre-formed, uniform pellets of commercial sausage. When questioned, staff admitted they don't make any ingredients in-house despite menu claims."
Excessive grease pooling,2024-07-05,2,"Had to continuously blot the pizza with napkins as pools of orange grease formed on top of the cheese with every passing minute. By the end, the napkins were completely saturated and transparent. Felt unhealthy even by pizza standards."

Authentic coal-fired perfection,2024-09-18,5,Their coal-fired oven gives the pizza a distinctive char and smoky flavor that's impossible to replicate any other way. The slight bitterness of the charred spots perfectly balances the sweetness of the sauce.
Pizza barely survived the drive home,2024-09-20,2,"Ordered takeout and by the time I got home (15 minutes), the pizza was a soggy mess. They clearly don't use appropriate packaging for takeout - no vents to release steam means the crust steams itself into sogginess."
Epic meat lovers option,2024-06-30,4,"If you're a carnivore, their 'Butcher's Block' pizza is incredible. Five different meats, all high quality - the soppressata and house-made sausage are standouts. Just be ready for a food coma afterward!"
Excellence in simplicity,2025-03-29,5,"Their classic Margherita showcases their commitment to quality - the balance of sweet-acidic tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella, fragrant basil, and that perfectly chewy-crisp crust. Proof that simple can be sublime."
Perfect balance of flavors,2023-05-05,5,"Their 'Mediterranean' pizza has the perfect balance of flavors - the briny olives, tangy feta, fresh tomatoes, and herb-infused olive oil all complement each other without any one element overwhelming the others."
Perfect for picky eaters,2023-07-04,4,Their 'build your own quarter' option is genius - a large pizza divided into quadrants with different toppings. Perfect for our family where everyone wants something different. No more ordering multiple pizzas!
Authentic Italian experience,2025-06-25,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
Best pizza in town,2023-02-20,5,"The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Their signature pepperoni pizza had the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, and the pepperoni curled up into little cups of deliciousness. Will definitely be back!"
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2023-06-17,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Perfect for kids' parties,2023-01-13,5,"Hosted my son's birthday here and it was fantastic. They did a dough-tossing demonstration for the kids, let them make their own mini pizzas, and the staff was incredibly patient and kind."
No flavor distinction,2025-05-22,3,Ordered two completely different specialty pizzas but they somehow tasted nearly identical. It's like they use the same base for everything and the toppings don't impart enough distinctive character.
Perfect temperature every time,2024-05-28,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2023-02-09,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."
Ideal char-to-chew ratio,2023-06-10,5,The small charred bubbles on the crust add amazing flavor without dominating. They've mastered that balance between the slight bitterness of char and the natural sweetness of the dough. Technical perfection!
Perfect crunch factor,2023-02-06,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."
Perfect for late-night cravings,2024-01-17,5,"Open until 3am on weekends, this place has saved many late nights. The slices are huge, they reheat them perfectly so they're crispy, and their special late-night menu items are creative and delicious."
Refrigerated dough taste,2025-02-06,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."
Painfully obvious cheap ingredients,2024-07-12,2,"The pre-shredded cheese didn't melt properly, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the sausage had that distinctive processed flavor. At these prices, cutting corners on ingredients is inexcusable."
New owners ruined it,2023-10-04,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."
Perfect balance of flavors,2024-03-12,5,"Their 'Mediterranean' pizza has the perfect balance of flavors - the briny olives, tangy feta, fresh tomatoes, and herb-infused olive oil all complement each other without any one element overwhelming the others."
Outstanding breakfast pizza,2024-02-14,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
Magnificent flavor layering,2024-03-22,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2024-01-07,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2024-11-15,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
Skimpy on toppings,2023-08-31,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."
Crispy yet chewy perfection,2025-03-29,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2023-03-07,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Rude staff ruined the meal,2025-03-24,2,"The pizza itself was decent, but the counter staff was incredibly rude - sighing when I asked questions about ingredients, rushing my order, and actually rolling their eyes when I requested extra napkins."
New owners ruined it,2023-09-10,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."
Bland sauce needs work,2023-11-16,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
Toppings slide right off,2025-06-26,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Best pizza in town,2024-07-20,5,"The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Their signature pepperoni pizza had the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, and the pepperoni curled up into little cups of deliciousness. Will definitely be back!"
Burnt crust ruins it,2024-08-08,2,"They claim 'char' is part of the Neapolitan experience, but there's a difference between char and burnt. The entire bottom of my pizza was black and bitter. Scraping it off meant losing half the crust."
Brilliant use of fermented dough,2024-10-27,5,Their 72-hour fermented dough has incredible depth of flavor with subtle sourdough notes. The extended fermentation creates a complex web of flavors and perfect texture that you simply can't achieve with quick-rise methods.
Too greasy to enjoy,2023-11-11,2,"Had to literally blot my pizza with napkins, which came away completely saturated with grease. Whatever flavor might have been there was drowned in oil. Couldn't finish it as it was making me feel ill."
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2025-06-29,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
Tiny portion sizes,2023-08-25,2,"Their 'personal' pizza is the size of a CD. For $15, I expected something that would actually satisfy my hunger. Had to order a second one, turning a quick lunch into an expensive disappointment."
Cheese solidified too quickly,2024-08-07,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Sloppy presentation,2025-03-28,3,"The pizza looked like it had been assembled in a hurry - toppings haphazardly thrown on, cheese unevenly distributed, and the cutting was so uneven that some slices were twice the size of others. Taste was okay, but appearance matters too."
Burnt crust ruins it,2023-10-21,2,"They claim 'char' is part of the Neapolitan experience, but there's a difference between char and burnt. The entire bottom of my pizza was black and bitter. Scraping it off meant losing half the crust."
Innovative toppings,2023-06-05,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."
Cold center burnt edges,2023-08-04,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Authentic coal-fired perfection,2023-01-08,5,Their coal-fired oven gives the pizza a distinctive char and smoky flavor that's impossible to replicate any other way. The slight bitterness of the charred spots perfectly balances the sweetness of the sauce.
Crust like cardboard,2025-06-29,2,"The crust had all the flavor and texture of packing material - dry, tough, and completely devoid of character. Even the decent toppings couldn't save it. The foundation of good pizza is good dough, and this wasn't it."
Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2023-07-14,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
Way too much crust,2024-06-11,2,The edge crust (cornicione) was comically large - almost half of each slice was just bread with no toppings. This ratio of crust to actual pizza was way off and made for a disappointing experience.
Too much emphasis on appearance,2023-06-06,3,"The pizza was clearly designed to look good in photos - perfect symmetry, vibrant colors, photogenic cheese pull - but the flavor was underwhelming. Style over substance for the Instagram crowd."
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2023-08-27,5,They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!
Not enough cheese,2025-05-11,3,"The sauce and crust were good, but they're stingy with cheese. You could see the sauce through the sparse cheese layer, and what was there didn't have that stretchy pull you want from a good pizza."
Magnificent flavor layering,2025-04-08,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Ideal char-to-chew ratio,2023-06-05,5,The small charred bubbles on the crust add amazing flavor without dominating. They've mastered that balance between the slight bitterness of char and the natural sweetness of the dough. Technical perfection!
Pizza barely survived the drive home,2024-09-02,2,"Ordered takeout and by the time I got home (15 minutes), the pizza was a soggy mess. They clearly don't use appropriate packaging for takeout - no vents to release steam means the crust steams itself into sogginess."
Excellent Chicago deep dish,2025-05-24,5,"Hard to find authentic Chicago-style pizza in this area, but they nail it. The buttery, flaky crust, the layering of cheese under the sauce, the chunky tomato topping - all perfect. Worth the 45-minute cook time."
Perfect crunch factor,2025-05-19,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."
Weird aftertaste,2025-01-17,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."
False advertising on size,2025-03-16,2,"Their menu clearly states that a large pizza is 16 inches, but what we received couldn't have been more than 14 inches. When questioned, they claimed their menu was outdated but refused any adjustment."
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2024-03-04,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Righteous ranch drizzle,2025-06-25,5,Their house-made ranch drizzle takes their pizzas to another level. It's not your typical ranch - has hints of dill and garlic with a perfect consistency that adds creaminess without making things soggy.
Masterclass in proper baking,2024-08-05,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
Excellent for takeout,2025-01-09,4,"Their pizza travels remarkably well. Even after a 20-minute drive home, the crust was still crispy and everything was at the perfect temperature. They have their packaging technique down to a science."
Underwhelming and basic,2024-09-08,3,"Nothing particularly wrong with it, but nothing memorable either. Standard crust, standard sauce, standard toppings. In a city with so many pizza options, this place doesn't give you any reason to return."
Sloppy presentation,2023-03-10,3,"The pizza looked like it had been assembled in a hurry - toppings haphazardly thrown on, cheese unevenly distributed, and the cutting was so uneven that some slices were twice the size of others. Taste was okay, but appearance matters too."
Excessive grease pooling,2025-04-08,2,"Had to continuously blot the pizza with napkins as pools of orange grease formed on top of the cheese with every passing minute. By the end, the napkins were completely saturated and transparent. Felt unhealthy even by pizza standards."
Burned bottom raw top,2024-11-16,1,The bottom of the crust was completely black while the cheese on top wasn't fully melted. This temperature imbalance suggests serious issues with their oven management and pizza-making technique.
Painfully obvious cheap ingredients,2024-02-23,2,"The pre-shredded cheese didn't melt properly, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the sausage had that distinctive processed flavor. At these prices, cutting corners on ingredients is inexcusable."
Excellent customer service,2024-10-16,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
Doughy and undercooked,2024-12-16,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Creative seasonal specials,2024-07-05,5,"Just had their spring special with asparagus, lemon ricotta, and prosciutto. The combination was bright, fresh, and perfect for the season. Love that they use local, seasonal ingredients."
Spicy special was too much,2023-08-29,2,Their 'Firebreather' pizza should come with a warning label. It wasn't enjoyably spicy - it was painfully hot to the point where I couldn't taste anything else. Had to throw most of it away.
Too thin to be satisfying,2024-12-02,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Best Hawaiian in the city,2025-06-21,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."
Inconsistent quality,2024-01-06,3,I've been here three times. First visit: amazing. Second: terrible. Third: just okay. Seems like it really depends on who's working that day. Wish they could maintain better quality control.
Excellent beer pairing suggestions,2023-12-15,5,"Not only is their pizza excellent (try the fig and prosciutto!), but the staff is knowledgeable about their craft beer selection and can suggest the perfect pairing for whatever pizza you order."
Perfect textural contrast,2025-01-16,5,"The contrast between the crisp bottom, the tender interior crumb, the gooey cheese, and the slight resistance of the toppings creates a textural symphony. Each bite is interesting and satisfying in a different way."
Excellence in simplicity,2023-11-14,5,"Their classic Margherita showcases their commitment to quality - the balance of sweet-acidic tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella, fragrant basil, and that perfectly chewy-crisp crust. Proof that simple can be sublime."
Righteous ranch drizzle,2025-03-23,5,Their house-made ranch drizzle takes their pizzas to another level. It's not your typical ranch - has hints of dill and garlic with a perfect consistency that adds creaminess without making things soggy.
New owners ruined it,2023-03-30,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."
Too salty,2023-10-24,2,"Everything I tried was oversalted - the crust, the sauce, and especially the cheese. It was like they were trying to ensure you'd order more drinks. Couldn't finish my pizza and was thirsty all night."
Too thin to be satisfying,2023-01-07,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Absurdly small slices,2023-03-04,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."
Perfect textural contrast,2024-01-20,5,"The contrast between the crisp bottom, the tender interior crumb, the gooey cheese, and the slight resistance of the toppings creates a textural symphony. Each bite is interesting and satisfying in a different way."
Perfect for big groups,2023-07-12,5,"We had a party of 12 and they accommodated us perfectly. Their 20-inch shareable pizzas are great for groups, and they were happy to do half-and-half toppings to please everyone. Service was impressively coordinated."
Refrigerated dough taste,2023-05-25,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."
Perfect for late-night cravings,2025-03-28,5,"Open until 3am on weekends, this place has saved many late nights. The slices are huge, they reheat them perfectly so they're crispy, and their special late-night menu items are creative and delicious."
Amazing Detroit-style,2023-02-02,5,"Their Detroit-style square pizza is incredible - crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior, and those corner pieces are to die for! The pepperoni cup and char perfectly. Worth the 30-minute wait."
Excellent attention to cooking time,2024-02-10,5,They nail the cooking time perfectly - pulling the pizza from the oven at exactly the right moment when the cheese is fully melted and bubbling but not yet browned. Shows expertise and attention to detail.
Mediocre at best,2024-05-07,3,"Nothing terrible but nothing special either. The crust was okay, toppings were standard, and service was fine. It's the kind of place you go when you're in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip for."
Family night favorite,2024-03-31,5,"We bring our kids here every Friday night. The staff always make them feel special, providing dough for them to play with while we wait. Their kid-sized pizzas are perfect, and the parents love the craft beer selection."
Way too much oregano,2023-07-31,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2024-05-13,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Underwhelming and basic,2024-10-13,3,"Nothing particularly wrong with it, but nothing memorable either. Standard crust, standard sauce, standard toppings. In a city with so many pizza options, this place doesn't give you any reason to return."
Perfectly crispy crust,2024-03-30,5,"However they achieve it, their crust has the perfect crispness all the way through - no soggy middle! Even the slices with lots of toppings maintain their structural integrity. Engineering marvel of pizza."
Skimpy on toppings,2024-07-19,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."
Doughy and undercooked,2025-04-08,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Outstanding breakfast pizza,2023-11-24,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
Terrible delivery experience,2025-05-24,1,"Ordered for Valentine's Day and regretted it. Pizza took 2 hours to arrive, was cold, and had the wrong toppings. Called the restaurant and they seemed completely unconcerned. Never again."
Tiny portion sizes,2024-08-09,2,"Their 'personal' pizza is the size of a CD. For $15, I expected something that would actually satisfy my hunger. Had to order a second one, turning a quick lunch into an expensive disappointment."

Epic meat lovers option,2024-11-05,4,"If you're a carnivore, their 'Butcher's Block' pizza is incredible. Five different meats, all high quality - the soppressata and house-made sausage are standouts. Just be ready for a food coma afterward!"
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2024-03-06,5,They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!

Undercooked in the middle,2025-01-23,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."
Too much cheese,2025-02-23,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Expert-level pizza folding,2024-03-22,5,Their thin-crust slices fold perfectly New York-style without cracking or losing toppings. The slight resistance before the fold is exactly what you want - showing the perfect balance of crisp and chew.
Greasy and disappointing,2024-04-16,2,"I had high hopes based on the reviews, but my pizza was swimming in grease. The crust was undercooked in the center, and the promised 'fresh vegetables' looked and tasted canned. Such a letdown."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2024-10-29,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Brilliant seasonal rotation,2024-12-28,5,"Love that they have a rotating seasonal pizza that showcases what's fresh. The current spring offering with asparagus, green garlic, and fresh peas is bright and delicious - a perfect reflection of the season."
Incredible vodka sauce base,2024-05-01,5,"Their vodka sauce pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil is something special. The creamy, slightly spicy sauce is a perfect alternative to traditional tomato sauce. Add prosciutto for an extra flavor dimension!"
Doughy and undercooked,2023-10-19,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Outstanding variety of options,2024-09-09,5,"Their menu has something for everyone - traditional options done well, creative specialties, and customizable choices. Even have dessert pizzas that are surprisingly good (try the Nutella and banana!)."
Perfect for kids' parties,2023-11-04,5,"Hosted my son's birthday here and it was fantastic. They did a dough-tossing demonstration for the kids, let them make their own mini pizzas, and the staff was incredibly patient and kind."

Perfect for picky eaters,2024-05-04,4,Their 'build your own quarter' option is genius - a large pizza divided into quadrants with different toppings. Perfect for our family where everyone wants something different. No more ordering multiple pizzas!
Perfect ingredient distribution,2025-06-09,5,"Every bite had the perfect combination of ingredients - no barren spots, no overwhelming clumps. The toppings were distributed with such precision it almost seemed measured. The mark of true professionals!"
Excellent for takeout,2024-03-16,4,"Their pizza travels remarkably well. Even after a 20-minute drive home, the crust was still crispy and everything was at the perfect temperature. They have their packaging technique down to a science."
All style no substance,2023-12-31,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."

Exceptional sauce-making technique,2024-02-17,5,"You can tell their sauce is made with properly hand-crushed tomatoes - it has that perfect texture with small chunks rather than being completely smooth. The bright flavor suggests minimal cooking, allowing the tomato quality to shine."
Stale-tasting crust,2024-01-08,2,"The crust had a stale, almost cardboard-like quality that suggests either old dough or old flour. Fresh ingredients on top couldn't compensate for the foundation being off."
Crust like cardboard,2025-05-19,2,"The crust had all the flavor and texture of packing material - dry, tough, and completely devoid of character. Even the decent toppings couldn't save it. The foundation of good pizza is good dough, and this wasn't it."
Excellent customer service,2024-03-18,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
Too much cornmeal,2024-12-27,3,"They use cornmeal on the bottom of the crust to prevent sticking, which is standard, but they use so much that it's like eating pizza on a sandpaper surface. Gritty texture overwhelms the experience."
Best white pizza ever,2023-01-30,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"
Too much cornmeal,2023-09-21,3,"They use cornmeal on the bottom of the crust to prevent sticking, which is standard, but they use so much that it's like eating pizza on a sandpaper surface. Gritty texture overwhelms the experience."
Doughy and undercooked,2024-03-22,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Masterful use of olive oil,2024-12-04,5,"The drizzle of high-quality olive oil they add just before serving makes all the difference - adds richness, enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, and adds a wonderful aromatic element. Simple but transformative."
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2024-05-23,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Righteous ranch drizzle,2023-07-14,5,Their house-made ranch drizzle takes their pizzas to another level. It's not your typical ranch - has hints of dill and garlic with a perfect consistency that adds creaminess without making things soggy.
Terrible delivery experience,2023-11-23,1,"Ordered for Valentine's Day and regretted it. Pizza took 2 hours to arrive, was cold, and had the wrong toppings. Called the restaurant and they seemed completely unconcerned. Never again."
Tough leathery crust,2025-02-10,2,"The crust was so tough I almost couldn't bite through it - like trying to eat leather. The edges were particularly problematic, had to tear pieces off with significant effort. Completely lacks the pleasant chewiness good pizza should have."
Perfect pepperoni placement,2024-08-02,5,"As a pepperoni perfectionist, I appreciate that they space the pepperoni so every bite gets one full piece. No bare spots or clumped areas. Shows attention to detail that elevates the whole experience."

Exceptional sauce-making technique,2024-02-12,5,"You can tell their sauce is made with properly hand-crushed tomatoes - it has that perfect texture with small chunks rather than being completely smooth. The bright flavor suggests minimal cooking, allowing the tomato quality to shine."
Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2024-02-05,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies. The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."
Pizza arrived upside-down,2024-05-24,1,Delivery driver must have taken a sharp turn because our pizza arrived completely flipped over in the box - all toppings stuck to the lid. Restaurant offered no solution other than suggesting we 'scrape it off and reassemble it.'

Absurdly small slices,2024-10-15,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."
Perfect ingredient distribution,2024-11-15,5,"Every bite had the perfect combination of ingredients - no barren spots, no overwhelming clumps. The toppings were distributed with such precision it almost seemed measured. The mark of true professionals!"
Way too much oregano,2025-01-03,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
Great gluten-free option,2025-02-20,4,"As someone with celiac disease, finding good gluten-free pizza is a challenge. Their cauliflower crust was one of the best I've had - doesn't fall apart and has a nice flavor. Toppings were generous too."
Burnt crust ruins it,2025-04-04,2,"They claim 'char' is part of the Neapolitan experience, but there's a difference between char and burnt. The entire bottom of my pizza was black and bitter. Scraping it off meant losing half the crust."
Incredible vodka sauce base,2024-05-10,5,"Their vodka sauce pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil is something special. The creamy, slightly spicy sauce is a perfect alternative to traditional tomato sauce. Add prosciutto for an extra flavor dimension!"
Best white pizza ever,2023-07-07,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"

Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"
Too much cheese,2024-10-28,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Sauce like ketchup,2024-01-26,2,"The sauce was suspiciously sweet and one-dimensional, reminiscent of ketchup rather than a proper pizza sauce. No evidence of herbs, garlic, or any complexity. Ruined what otherwise could have been a decent pizza."
Excellent Chicago deep dish,2024-11-26,5,"Hard to find authentic Chicago-style pizza in this area, but they nail it. The buttery, flaky crust, the layering of cheese under the sauce, the chunky tomato topping - all perfect. Worth the 45-minute cook time."
Too salty,2025-05-19,2,"Everything I tried was oversalted - the crust, the sauce, and especially the cheese. It was like they were trying to ensure you'd order more drinks. Couldn't finish my pizza and was thirsty all night."
False advertising on size,2023-06-22,2,"Their menu clearly states that a large pizza is 16 inches, but what we received couldn't have been more than 14 inches. When questioned, they claimed their menu was outdated but refused any adjustment."
Phenomenal crust,2023-01-11,5,"Whatever they do to their dough is magical - it's got that perfect combination of crispy and chewy with a slight sourdough tang. I could eat their plain crust by itself, it's that good."
Weird aftertaste,2025-06-15,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."
Best Hawaiian in the city,2023-01-10,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."
Too much cornmeal,2024-07-12,3,"They use cornmeal on the bottom of the crust to prevent sticking, which is standard, but they use so much that it's like eating pizza on a sandpaper surface. Gritty texture overwhelms the experience."

Perfect thin crust,2025-01-05,5,"If you're a thin crust fan, this is your place. Cracker-thin, crispy all the way through, yet somehow still has a nice chew. Their simple cheese pizza showcases their excellent sauce - slightly sweet with a nice herb blend."
Stale-tasting crust,2025-04-05,2,"The crust had a stale, almost cardboard-like quality that suggests either old dough or old flour. Fresh ingredients on top couldn't compensate for the foundation being off."
Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2023-10-02,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies. The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."
Weird aftertaste,2023-12-30,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."
Tiny portion sizes,2023-08-25,2,"Their 'personal' pizza is the size of a CD. For $15, I expected something that would actually satisfy my hunger. Had to order a second one, turning a quick lunch into an expensive disappointment."
Too much emphasis on appearance,2023-09-19,3,"The pizza was clearly designed to look good in photos - perfect symmetry, vibrant colors, photogenic cheese pull - but the flavor was underwhelming. Style over substance for the Instagram crowd."
Too greasy to enjoy,2023-03-11,2,"Had to literally blot my pizza with napkins, which came away completely saturated with grease. Whatever flavor might have been there was drowned in oil. Couldn't finish it as it was making me feel ill."
Burned bottom raw top,2025-04-15,1,The bottom of the crust was completely black while the cheese on top wasn't fully melted. This temperature imbalance suggests serious issues with their oven management and pizza-making technique.
Masterful use of olive oil,2024-10-31,5,"The drizzle of high-quality olive oil they add just before serving makes all the difference - adds richness, enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, and adds a wonderful aromatic element. Simple but transformative."

Best pizza in town,2025-05-21,5,"The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Their signature pepperoni pizza had the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, and the pepperoni curled up into little cups of deliciousness. Will definitely be back!"
Painfully obvious cheap ingredients,2024-07-01,2,"The pre-shredded cheese didn't melt properly, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the sausage had that distinctive processed flavor. At these prices, cutting corners on ingredients is inexcusable."
Underwhelming and basic,2024-08-25,3,"Nothing particularly wrong with it, but nothing memorable either. Standard crust, standard sauce, standard toppings. In a city with so many pizza options, this place doesn't give you any reason to return."
Perfect buffalo mozzarella application,2025-02-15,5,They understand that buffalo mozzarella shouldn't be cooked too long or it loses its distinctive texture and flavor. Applied in dollops after the pizza is mostly baked so it just barely melts while maintaining its creamy integrity. Technical perfection!
Way too much oregano,2023-07-18,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2023-09-29,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
Inconsistent quality,2025-05-04,3,I've been here three times. First visit: amazing. Second: terrible. Third: just okay. Seems like it really depends on who's working that day. Wish they could maintain better quality control.
Outstanding wood-fired perfection,2023-11-29,5,The wood-fired oven gives their pizza a distinctive smoky complexity you can't get any other way. The slight char adds bitterness that balances the sweetness of the sauce perfectly. Worth seeking out for this unique flavor profile.
Exceptional spinach ricotta pie,2024-02-17,5,Their white pizza with spinach and ricotta is exceptional - the creamy richness of the cheese balanced by the slight bitterness of the greens. The garlic-infused olive oil base ties everything together perfectly.
Excellence in simplicity,2025-05-02,5,"Their classic Margherita showcases their commitment to quality - the balance of sweet-acidic tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella, fragrant basil, and that perfectly chewy-crisp crust. Proof that simple can be sublime."
Late night savior,2023-09-30,4,"Open until 2am on weekends, this place has saved me many times after a night out. Their slices are huge, reheated perfectly crisp, and they have creative toppings that hit the spot when you're hungry late at night."
Outstanding variety of options,2025-05-05,5,"Their menu has something for everyone - traditional options done well, creative specialties, and customizable choices. Even have dessert pizzas that are surprisingly good (try the Nutella and banana!)."
Masterclass in proper baking,2023-01-04,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
Perfect for dietary restrictions,2023-04-26,5,"As someone with multiple food allergies, I appreciate that they take dietary concerns seriously.

Crust like cardboard,2025-02-08,2,"The crust had all the flavor and texture of packing material - dry, tough, and completely devoid of character. Even the decent toppings couldn't save it. The foundation of good pizza is good dough, and this wasn't it."
Ideal char-to-chew ratio,2023-04-10,5,The small charred bubbles on the crust add amazing flavor without dominating. They've mastered that balance between the slight bitterness of char and the natural sweetness of the dough. Technical perfection!

Tasteless cheese substitute,2023-11-21,2,"Their vegan cheese option was terrible - had no meltability, a grainy texture, and tasted strongly of coconut which clashed with the tomato sauce. If you can't do vegan cheese well, better to offer cheese-free options that are properly balanced."
Crispy yet chewy perfection,2023-03-20,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."
Way too much crust,2024-08-27,2,The edge crust (cornicione) was comically large - almost half of each slice was just bread with no toppings. This ratio of crust to actual pizza was way off and made for a disappointing experience.
Perfect for kids' parties,2023-11-25,5,"Hosted my son's birthday here and it was fantastic. They did a dough-tossing demonstration for the kids, let them make their own mini pizzas, and the staff was incredibly patient and kind."

Too much sauce,2024-02-18,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
New owners ruined it,2024-01-05,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."
Toppings slide right off,2024-05-31,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Doughy and undercooked,2024-08-13,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Too thin to be satisfying,2023-03-13,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."

Refrigerated dough taste,2024-12-26,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."
Crispy yet chewy perfection,2023-12-25,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."
Pizza barely survived the drive home,2024-12-12,2,"Ordered takeout and by the time I got home (15 minutes), the pizza was a soggy mess. They clearly don't use appropriate packaging for takeout - no vents to release steam means the crust steams itself into sogginess."
Perfect buffalo mozzarella application,2023-02-19,5,They understand that buffalo mozzarella shouldn't be cooked too long or it loses its distinctive texture and flavor. Applied in dollops after the pizza is mostly baked so it just barely melts while maintaining its creamy integrity. Technical perfection!
Not worth the wait,2025-03-29,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."
Excessive grease pooling,2023-01-19,2,"Had to continuously blot the pizza with napkins as pools of orange grease formed on top of the cheese with every passing minute. By the end, the napkins were completely saturated and transparent. Felt unhealthy even by pizza standards."

Outstanding breakfast pizza,2024-05-11,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"

Too expensive for pizza,2023-05-25,3,"The pizza is good, I'll give them that. But $30 for a basic large cheese pizza is highway robbery. Add toppings and you're looking at $40-50. The quality doesn't justify these premium prices."

Expert-level pizza folding,2023-03-19,5,Their thin-crust slices fold perfectly New York-style without cracking or losing toppings. The slight resistance before the fold is exactly what you want - showing the perfect balance of crisp and chew.
Disappointed with service,2023-04-23,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."
All style no substance,2024-08-24,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."

Unmelted cheese in the center,2024-01-18,2,"The edges were fine but the center had cold, unmelted cheese - a sign the oven wasn't hot enough or the pizza wasn't cooked long enough. Basic pizza fundamentals seem to be lacking."
Too much cheese,2024-01-03,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Perfect buffalo mozzarella application,2025-05-28,5,They understand that buffalo mozzarella shouldn't be cooked too long or it loses its distinctive texture and flavor. Applied in dollops after the pizza is mostly baked so it just barely melts while maintaining its creamy integrity. Technical perfection!
Innovative toppings,2023-04-06,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."
Sloppy presentation,2023-05-14,3,"The pizza looked like it had been assembled in a hurry - toppings haphazardly thrown on, cheese unevenly distributed, and the cutting was so uneven that some slices were twice the size of others. Taste was okay, but appearance matters too."
All style no substance,2025-03-25,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."
Perfect temperature every time,2024-08-03,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
Mediocre at best,2023-12-19,3,"Nothing terrible but nothing special either. The crust was okay, toppings were standard, and service was fine. It's the kind of place you go when you're in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip for."
Doughy and undercooked,2023-01-27,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Perfect ingredient distribution,2023-08-22,5,"Every bite had the perfect combination of ingredients - no barren spots, no overwhelming clumps. The toppings were distributed with such precision it almost seemed measured. The mark of true professionals!"
Absurdly small slices,2025-02-01,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."
Perfect for picky eaters,2023-04-18,4,Their 'build your own quarter' option is genius - a large pizza divided into quadrants with different toppings. Perfect for our family where everyone wants something different. No more ordering multiple pizzas!
Underwhelming and basic,2024-07-13,3,"Nothing particularly wrong with it, but nothing memorable either. Standard crust, standard sauce, standard toppings. In a city with so many pizza options, this place doesn't give you any reason to return."
Outstanding breakfast pizza,2024-03-04,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
Too much cornmeal,2024-10-24,3,"They use cornmeal on the bottom of the crust to prevent sticking, which is standard, but they use so much that it's like eating pizza on a sandpaper surface. Gritty texture overwhelms the experience."
Magnificent flavor layering,2025-02-23,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
New owners ruined it,2024-01-31,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."
Way too much oregano,2023-07-25,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
Magnificent flavor layering,2023-08-02,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."

Tiny portion sizes,2024-01-14,2,"Their 'personal' pizza is the size of a CD. For $15, I expected something that would actually satisfy my hunger. Had to order a second one, turning a quick lunch into an expensive disappointment."
Best white pizza ever,2024-07-31,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"
Tomato sauce tasted rancid,2024-11-22,1,"The sauce had a distinctly off flavor that suggested the tomatoes had gone bad before processing. After two bites, couldn't continue eating as the rancid notes became more pronounced. Basic food safety seems questionable."
Perfect for watching sports,2024-01-12,4,"Great setup with TVs visible from every table, excellent pitcher specials during games, and their 'Game Day' pizza loaded with multiple meats and jalapeños is the perfect sports-watching food. Atmosphere gets lively but not obnoxious."
Authentic Italian experience,2025-06-29,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
Crispy yet chewy perfection,2024-10-24,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."
Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2025-04-17,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies. The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2024-06-04,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
Magnificent flavor layering,2025-06-24,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Unmelted cheese in the center,2025-02-17,2,"The edges were fine but the center had cold, unmelted cheese - a sign the oven wasn't hot enough or the pizza wasn't cooked long enough. Basic pizza fundamentals seem to be lacking."
Not worth the wait,2025-06-06,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."
Excellent attention to cooking time,2024-07-12,5,They nail the cooking time perfectly - pulling the pizza from the oven at exactly the right moment when the cheese is fully melted and bubbling but not yet browned. Shows expertise and attention to detail.
Dirty restaurant,2024-05-16,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."
Mediocre at best,2023-09-29,3,"Nothing terrible but nothing special either. The crust was okay, toppings were standard, and service was fine. It's the kind of place you go when you're in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip for."
Excellent beer pairing suggestions,2023-09-11,5,"Not only is their pizza excellent (try the fig and prosciutto!), but the staff is knowledgeable about their craft beer selection and can suggest the perfect pairing for whatever pizza you order."
Underwhelming and basic,2023-03-12,3,"Nothing particularly wrong with it, but nothing memorable either. Standard crust, standard sauce, standard toppings. In a city with so many pizza options, this place doesn't give you any reason to return."
Tiny portion sizes,2025-05-24,2,"Their 'personal' pizza is the size of a CD. For $15, I expected something that would actually satisfy my hunger. Had to order a second one, turning a quick lunch into an expensive disappointment."
False advertising on size,2024-10-07,2,"Their menu clearly states that a large pizza is 16 inches, but what we received couldn't have been more than 14 inches. When questioned, they claimed their menu was outdated but refused any adjustment."
Doughy and undercooked,2024-03-14,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2025-03-28,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."
Innovative flavor combinations,2025-05-02,5,"Their 'Avant Garde' menu section features combinations I would never have thought of but somehow work perfectly. The pear, gorgonzola, walnut, and honey pizza was a revelation of sweet, salty, and savory harmony."
Cold center burnt edges,2023-04-19,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Perfect temperature every time,2024-03-12,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
Perfect textural contrast,2024-10-17,5,"The contrast between the crisp bottom, the tender interior crumb, the gooey cheese, and the slight resistance of the toppings creates a textural symphony. Each bite is interesting and satisfying in a different way."
Too much salt in the dough,2024-08-19,2,The crust was so salty it was almost inedible - overwhelmed all the other flavors and left me incredibly thirsty afterward. A heavy hand with salt ruined what could have been a good pizza.
No-cheese option was all sauce,2024-07-17,2,"Ordered a cheese-free pizza for my dairy-allergic friend, but they made no adjustments - just removed the cheese and left a soggy sauce-covered bread. Good pizza without cheese requires rebalancing other elements."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2023-06-25,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Perfectly crispy crust,2024-09-27,5,"However they achieve it, their crust has the perfect crispness all the way through - no soggy middle! Even the slices with lots of toppings maintain their structural integrity. Engineering marvel of pizza."
Too much salt in the dough,2024-11-26,2,The crust was so salty it was almost inedible - overwhelmed all the other flavors and left me incredibly thirsty afterward. A heavy hand with salt ruined what could have been a good pizza.
Unmelted cheese in the center,2024-01-06,2,"The edges were fine but the center had cold, unmelted cheese - a sign the oven wasn't hot enough or the pizza wasn't cooked long enough. Basic pizza fundamentals seem to be lacking."
Too much cheese,2023-01-31,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Absurdly small slices,2025-03-22,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."
Too noisy for conversation,2023-07-14,3,The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option.
Way too much crust,2024-04-15,2,The edge crust (cornicione) was comically large - almost half of each slice was just bread with no toppings. This ratio of crust to actual pizza was way off and made for a disappointing experience.
Too salty,2024-01-29,2,"Everything I tried was oversalted - the crust, the sauce, and especially the cheese. It was like they were trying to ensure you'd order more drinks. Couldn't finish my pizza and was thirsty all night."
Overpriced for what you get,2024-06-27,3,"$24 for a medium pizza with just two toppings seems excessive. The ingredients were fresh and the crust was good, but nothing justified the premium price. There are better values elsewhere in town."
No flavor distinction,2023-06-05,3,Ordered two completely different specialty pizzas but they somehow tasted nearly identical. It's like they use the same base for everything and the toppings don't impart enough distinctive character.
Authentic Italian experience,2024-11-20,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
Refrigerated dough taste,2023-09-19,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."
Perfect temperature every time,2024-03-20,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
Crust like cardboard,2025-01-13,2,"The crust had all the flavor and texture of packing material - dry, tough, and completely devoid of character. Even the decent toppings couldn't save it. The foundation of good pizza is good dough, and this wasn't it."
Stale-tasting crust,2025-01-08,2,"The crust had a stale, almost cardboard-like quality that suggests either old dough or old flour. Fresh ingredients on top couldn't compensate for the foundation being off."
Excellent wine pairings,2023-04-09,5,"Their curated wine list is designed specifically to pair with their pizzas, and the staff is knowledgeable about suggesting the perfect match. The house red with their sausage pizza is a transcendent combination."
Family night favorite,2024-10-22,5,"We bring our kids here every Friday night. The staff always make them feel special, providing dough for them to play with while we wait. Their kid-sized pizzas are perfect, and the parents love the craft beer selection."
Terrible delivery experience,2025-05-08,1,"Ordered for Valentine's Day and regretted it. Pizza took 2 hours to arrive, was cold, and had the wrong toppings. Called the restaurant and they seemed completely unconcerned. Never again."
Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2023-12-21,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies. The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."
Perfect for big groups,2023-10-28,5,"We had a party of 12 and they accommodated us perfectly. Their 20-inch shareable pizzas are great for groups, and they were happy to do half-and-half toppings to please everyone. Service was impressively coordinated."
Outstanding variety of options,2025-02-10,5,"Their menu has something for everyone - traditional options done well, creative specialties, and customizable choices. Even have dessert pizzas that are surprisingly good (try the Nutella and banana!)."
Too much garlic,2023-11-04,3,"I love garlic but this was excessive - felt like they mistook cloves for teaspoons in the recipe. My breath was lethal afterward, and the powerful flavor overwhelmed the other ingredients."
Perfect ingredient distribution,2023-03-21,5,"Every bite had the perfect combination of ingredients - no barren spots, no overwhelming clumps. The toppings were distributed with such precision it almost seemed measured. The mark of true professionals!"
Exceptional spinach ricotta pie,2025-01-03,5,Their white pizza with spinach and ricotta is exceptional - the creamy richness of the cheese balanced by the slight bitterness of the greens. The garlic-infused olive oil base ties everything together perfectly.
Perfect thin crust,2024-07-14,5,"If you're a thin crust fan, this is your place. Cracker-thin, crispy all the way through, yet somehow still has a nice chew. Their simple cheese pizza showcases their excellent sauce - slightly sweet with a nice herb blend."
Epic meat lovers option,2024-02-22,4,"If you're a carnivore, their 'Butcher's Block' pizza is incredible. Five different meats, all high quality - the soppressata and house-made sausage are standouts. Just be ready for a food coma afterward!"
Perfect for dietary restrictions,2024-03-05,5,"As someone with multiple food allergies, I appreciate that they take dietary concerns seriously. Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2025-03-16,5,They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!
Undercooked in the middle,2023-01-26,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."
Tomato sauce tasted rancid,2023-10-20,1,"The sauce had a distinctly off flavor that suggested the tomatoes had gone bad before processing. After two bites, couldn't continue eating as the rancid notes became more pronounced. Basic food safety seems questionable."
Too much sauce,2023-08-13,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Rude staff ruined the meal,2023-01-08,2,"The pizza itself was decent, but the counter staff was incredibly rude - sighing when I asked questions about ingredients, rushing my order, and actually rolling their eyes when I requested extra napkins."
Tiny portion sizes,2023-02-03,2,"Their 'personal' pizza is the size of a CD. For $15, I expected something that would actually satisfy my hunger. Had to order a second one, turning a quick lunch into an expensive disappointment."

Perfect textural contrast,2024-11-18,5,"The contrast between the crisp bottom, the tender interior crumb, the gooey cheese, and the slight resistance of the toppings creates a textural symphony. Each bite is interesting and satisfying in a different way."
Brilliant use of fermented dough,2024-02-01,5,Their 72-hour fermented dough has incredible depth of flavor with subtle sourdough notes. The extended fermentation creates a complex web of flavors and perfect texture that you simply can't achieve with quick-rise methods.
Perfect for dietary restrictions,2023-04-20,5,"As someone with multiple food allergies, I appreciate that they take dietary concerns seriously. Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"

Excellent for takeout,2023-01-08,4,"Their pizza travels remarkably well. Even after a 20-minute drive home, the crust was still crispy and everything was at the perfect temperature. They have their packaging technique down to a science."
Unmelted cheese in the center,2024-04-29,2,"The edges were fine but the center had cold, unmelted cheese - a sign the oven wasn't hot enough or the pizza wasn't cooked long enough. Basic pizza fundamentals seem to be lacking."
Burned mouth on first bite,2024-05-19,2,"They served the pizza dangerously hot - barely out of the oven with no time to cool. Severely burned the roof of my mouth on the first bite, which ruined the rest of the meal and my next few days."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2024-06-20,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Dirty restaurant,2025-05-11,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."

Perfectly crispy crust,2024-05-21,5,"However they achieve it, their crust has the perfect crispness all the way through - no soggy middle! Even the slices with lots of toppings maintain their structural integrity. Engineering marvel of pizza."
Pizza barely survived the drive home,2023-04-05,2,"Ordered takeout and by the time I got home (15 minutes), the pizza was a soggy mess. They clearly don't use appropriate packaging for takeout - no vents to release steam means the crust steams itself into sogginess."
Tasteless cheese substitute,2025-04-16,2,"Their vegan cheese option was terrible - had no meltability, a grainy texture, and tasted strongly of coconut which clashed with the tomato sauce. If you can't do vegan cheese well, better to offer cheese-free options that are properly balanced."
Best Hawaiian in the city,2024-08-14,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."

Expert-level pizza folding,2023-06-08,5,Their thin-crust slices fold perfectly New York-style without cracking or losing toppings. The slight resistance before the fold is exactly what you want - showing the perfect balance of crisp and chew.
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2024-12-07,5,They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!
Ideal char-to-chew ratio,2023-09-03,5,The small charred bubbles on the crust add amazing flavor without dominating. They've mastered that balance between the slight bitterness of char and the natural sweetness of the dough. Technical perfection!
Outstanding variety of options,2024-07-24,5,"Their menu has something for everyone - traditional options done well, creative specialties, and customizable choices. Even have dessert pizzas that are surprisingly good (try the Nutella and banana!)."
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2023-03-06,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."

Too expensive for pizza,2023-01-14,3,"The pizza is good, I'll give them that. But $30 for a basic large cheese pizza is highway robbery. Add toppings and you're looking at $40-50. The quality doesn't justify these premium prices."
Brilliant seasonal rotation,2023-03-31,5,"Love that they have a rotating seasonal pizza that showcases what's fresh. The current spring offering with asparagus, green garlic, and fresh peas is bright and delicious - a perfect reflection of the season."
Perfect crunch factor,2025-05-08,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."
Expert-level pizza folding,2025-05-13,5,Their thin-crust slices fold perfectly New York-style without cracking or losing toppings. The slight resistance before the fold is exactly what you want - showing the perfect balance of crisp and chew.

Best pizza in town,2025-05-14,5,"The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Their signature pepperoni pizza had the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, and the pepperoni curled up into little cups of deliciousness. Will definitely be back!"
Excessive grease pooling,2024-02-28,2,"Had to continuously blot the pizza with napkins as pools of orange grease formed on top of the cheese with every passing minute. By the end, the napkins were completely saturated and transparent. Felt unhealthy even by pizza standards."
Great gluten-free option,2024-06-15,4,"As someone with celiac disease, finding good gluten-free pizza is a challenge. Their cauliflower crust was one of the best I've had - doesn't fall apart and has a nice flavor. Toppings were generous too."

Late night savior,2023-08-16,4,"Open until 2am on weekends, this place has saved me many times after a night out. Their slices are huge, reheated perfectly crisp, and they have creative toppings that hit the spot when you're hungry late at night."
Perfect temperature every time,2023-08-13,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."

Not enough cheese,2023-10-14,3,"The sauce and crust were good, but they're stingy with cheese. You could see the sauce through the sparse cheese layer, and what was there didn't have that stretchy pull you want from a good pizza."
Righteous ranch drizzle,2023-09-01,5,Their house-made ranch drizzle takes their pizzas to another level. It's not your typical ranch - has hints of dill and garlic with a perfect consistency that adds creaminess without making things soggy.
Exceptional sauce-making technique,2023-10-26,5,"You can tell their sauce is made with properly hand-crushed tomatoes - it has that perfect texture with small chunks rather than being completely smooth. The bright flavor suggests minimal cooking, allowing the tomato quality to shine."
Perfect ingredient distribution,2024-05-28,5,"Every bite had the perfect combination of ingredients - no barren spots, no overwhelming clumps. The toppings were distributed with such precision it almost seemed measured. The mark of true professionals!"
Too much salt in the dough,2023-11-20,2,The crust was so salty it was almost inedible - overwhelmed all the other flavors and left me incredibly thirsty afterward. A heavy hand with salt ruined what could have been a good pizza.
Crispy yet chewy perfection,2024-03-29,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."
Perfect for lunch specials,2025-01-31,4,"Their lunch deal is unbeatable - $10 for a 10-inch pizza and small salad. The pizza comes out quickly, is always fresh, and the perfect size for one person. Great place for a work lunch."
Too much emphasis on appearance,2023-02-07,3,"The pizza was clearly designed to look good in photos - perfect symmetry, vibrant colors, photogenic cheese pull - but the flavor was underwhelming. Style over substance for the Instagram crowd."
Weird aftertaste,2023-11-06,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."
Outstanding variety of options,2023-10-19,5,"Their menu has something for everyone - traditional options done well, creative specialties, and customizable choices. Even have dessert pizzas that are surprisingly good (try the Nutella and banana!)."
Disappointed with service,2025-04-22,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."
Disappointed with service,2024-11-22,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."
Too much cheese,2024-12-20,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Phenomenal crust,2023-07-09,5,"Whatever they do to their dough is magical - it's got that perfect combination of crispy and chewy with a slight sourdough tang. I could eat their plain crust by itself, it's that good."
Undercooked in the middle,2024-09-24,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."
Outstanding wood-fired perfection,2025-05-17,5,The wood-fired oven gives their pizza a distinctive smoky complexity you can't get any other way. The slight char adds bitterness that balances the sweetness of the sauce perfectly. Worth seeking out for this unique flavor profile.
Absurdly small slices,2023-06-05,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."
Hidden gem for vegans,2024-07-27,5,"I can't believe how good their vegan pizza is! They make their own cashew cheese that actually melts properly, and their vegetable toppings are always fresh and seasonal. Even my non-vegan friends love it."
Expert-level pizza folding,2023-11-05,5,Their thin-crust slices fold perfectly New York-style without cracking or losing toppings. The slight resistance before the fold is exactly what you want - showing the perfect balance of crisp and chew.
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2024-09-14,5,They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!
Perfect for picky eaters,2023-06-11,4,Their 'build your own quarter' option is genius - a large pizza divided into quadrants with different toppings. Perfect for our family where everyone wants something different. No more ordering multiple pizzas!
Supreme quality control,2024-09-24,5,"Visited multiple times and the consistency is impressive - every pizza comes out identical to the last one, with the same excellent quality. Shows serious commitment to training and standards that's rare in casual dining."
Mediocre at best,2024-08-02,3,"Nothing terrible but nothing special either. The crust was okay, toppings were standard, and service was fine. It's the kind of place you go when you're in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip for."
Perfect NY-style slices,2023-08-06,5,"As a transplant from NYC, I've been searching for authentic NY-style pizza. This place nails it - thin, foldable slices with the right amount of chew and grease. Their plain cheese slice is perfection."
Sauce like ketchup,2023-01-03,2,"The sauce was suspiciously sweet and one-dimensional, reminiscent of ketchup rather than a proper pizza sauce. No evidence of herbs, garlic, or any complexity. Ruined what otherwise could have been a decent pizza."
Innovative toppings,2024-07-18,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."
Too much salt in the dough,2024-05-25,2,The crust was so salty it was almost inedible - overwhelmed all the other flavors and left me incredibly thirsty afterward. A heavy hand with salt ruined what could have been a good pizza.
Too much emphasis on appearance,2024-02-29,3,"The pizza was clearly designed to look good in photos - perfect symmetry, vibrant colors, photogenic cheese pull - but the flavor was underwhelming. Style over substance for the Instagram crowd."
Outstanding breakfast pizza,2024-03-14,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
Excellent for takeout,2024-01-07,4,"Their pizza travels remarkably well. Even after a 20-minute drive home, the crust was still crispy and everything was at the perfect temperature. They have their packaging technique down to a science."
Outstanding breakfast pizza,2024-12-22,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
Great gluten-free option,2023-07-01,4,"As someone with celiac disease, finding good gluten-free pizza is a challenge. Their cauliflower crust was one of the best I've had - doesn't fall apart and has a nice flavor. Toppings were generous too."
No-cheese option was all sauce,2024-11-27,2,"Ordered a cheese-free pizza for my dairy-allergic friend, but they made no adjustments - just removed the cheese and left a soggy sauce-covered bread. Good pizza without cheese requires rebalancing other elements."
Perfect for picky eaters,2024-06-18,4,Their 'build your own quarter' option is genius - a large pizza divided into quadrants with different toppings. Perfect for our family where everyone wants something different. No more ordering multiple pizzas!
Tough leathery crust,2025-03-02,2,"The crust was so tough I almost couldn't bite through it - like trying to eat leather. The edges were particularly problematic, had to tear pieces off with significant effort. Completely lacks the pleasant chewiness good pizza should have."
Perfect pepperoni placement,2024-02-08,5,"As a pepperoni perfectionist, I appreciate that they space the pepperoni so every bite gets one full piece. No bare spots or clumped areas. Shows attention to detail that elevates the whole experience."
Weird aftertaste,2025-06-16,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."
Weird aftertaste,2023-04-30,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."
Perfect crunch factor,2024-11-11,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2023-04-20,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Perfect for lunch specials,2024-08-20,4,"Their lunch deal is unbeatable - $10 for a 10-inch pizza and small salad. The pizza comes out quickly, is always fresh, and the perfect size for one person. Great place for a work lunch."
Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2023-04-18,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies. The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."
Sloppy presentation,2023-12-26,3,"The pizza looked like it had been assembled in a hurry - toppings haphazardly thrown on, cheese unevenly distributed, and the cutting was so uneven that some slices were twice the size of others. Taste was okay, but appearance matters too."
Magnificent flavor layering,2025-03-29,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Best Hawaiian in the city,2025-05-20,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2025-06-11,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."
Hidden gem for vegans,2023-02-12,5,"I can't believe how good their vegan pizza is! They make their own cashew cheese that actually melts properly, and their vegetable toppings are always fresh and seasonal. Even my non-vegan friends love it."
Refrigerated dough taste,2024-07-22,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."
Burned mouth on first bite,2023-06-25,2,"They served the pizza dangerously hot - barely out of the oven with no time to cool. Severely burned the roof of my mouth on the first bite, which ruined the rest of the meal and my next few days."
Amazing Detroit-style,2024-03-13,5,"Their Detroit-style square pizza is incredible - crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior, and those corner pieces are to die for! The pepperoni cup and char perfectly. Worth the 30-minute wait."
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2024-10-14,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Perfect for picky eaters,2023-09-15,4,Their 'build your own quarter' option is genius - a large pizza divided into quadrants with different toppings. Perfect for our family where everyone wants something different. No more ordering multiple pizzas!

Authentic coal-fired perfection,2025-01-31,5,Their coal-fired oven gives the pizza a distinctive char and smoky flavor that's impossible to replicate any other way. The slight bitterness of the charred spots perfectly balances the sweetness of the sauce.
Too thin to be satisfying,2024-08-20,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Perfectly crispy crust,2024-01-22,5,"However they achieve it, their crust has the perfect crispness all the way through - no soggy middle! Even the slices with lots of toppings maintain their structural integrity. Engineering marvel of pizza."
Tiny portion sizes,2024-10-08,2,"Their 'personal' pizza is the size of a CD. For $15, I expected something that would actually satisfy my hunger. Had to order a second one, turning a quick lunch into an expensive disappointment."
Perfect for kids' parties,2025-02-20,5,"Hosted my son's birthday here and it was fantastic. They did a dough-tossing demonstration for the kids, let them make their own mini pizzas, and the staff was incredibly patient and kind."
Tomato sauce tasted rancid,2024-09-15,1,"The sauce had a distinctly off flavor that suggested the tomatoes had gone bad before processing. After two bites, couldn't continue eating as the rancid notes became more pronounced. Basic food safety seems questionable."
Perfect for large parties,2024-09-04,5,"Their party package is fantastic - multiple 18-inch pizzas with varied toppings, plenty of sides, and they were accommodating with our group of 20. Everything arrived hot and on time, and they included all the necessary paper goods."
Underwhelming and basic,2024-07-27,3,"Nothing particularly wrong with it, but nothing memorable either. Standard crust, standard sauce, standard toppings. In a city with so many pizza options, this place doesn't give you any reason to return."
Best Hawaiian in the city,2023-08-12,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."
Great gluten-free option,2023-04-27,4,"As someone with celiac disease, finding good gluten-free pizza is a challenge. Their cauliflower crust was one of the best I've had - doesn't fall apart and has a nice flavor. Toppings were generous too."
Perfect balance of flavors,2024-05-06,5,"Their 'Mediterranean' pizza has the perfect balance of flavors - the briny olives, tangy feta, fresh tomatoes, and herb-infused olive oil all complement each other without any one element overwhelming the others."
Crispy yet chewy perfection,2024-07-07,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."
Perfect for watching sports,2023-08-21,4,"Great setup with TVs visible from every table, excellent pitcher specials during games, and their 'Game Day' pizza loaded with multiple meats and jalapeños is the perfect sports-watching food. Atmosphere gets lively but not obnoxious."
Too thin to be satisfying,2024-03-22,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Cold center burnt edges,2024-05-28,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Authentic Italian experience,2025-04-20,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
Refrigerated dough taste,2024-04-27,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."

All style no substance,2023-09-12,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."
Perfect pepperoni placement,2024-02-14,5,"As a pepperoni perfectionist, I appreciate that they space the pepperoni so every bite gets one full piece. No bare spots or clumped areas. Shows attention to detail that elevates the whole experience."
Terrible delivery experience,2024-06-23,1,"Ordered for Valentine's Day and regretted it. Pizza took 2 hours to arrive, was cold, and had the wrong toppings. Called the restaurant and they seemed completely unconcerned. Never again."
New owners ruined it,2023-09-07,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."
Brilliant seasonal rotation,2023-09-02,5,"Love that they have a rotating seasonal pizza that showcases what's fresh. The current spring offering with asparagus, green garlic, and fresh peas is bright and delicious - a perfect reflection of the season."
Great gluten-free option,2024-10-22,4,"As someone with celiac disease, finding good gluten-free pizza is a challenge. Their cauliflower crust was one of the best I've had - doesn't fall apart and has a nice flavor. Toppings were generous too."
Excellent customer service,2023-01-25,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
Dirty restaurant,2024-12-15,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."
Brilliant seasonal rotation,2024-12-02,5,"Love that they have a rotating seasonal pizza that showcases what's fresh. The current spring offering with asparagus, green garlic, and fresh peas is bright and delicious - a perfect reflection of the season."
Too greasy to enjoy,2023-08-27,2,"Had to literally blot my pizza with napkins, which came away completely saturated with grease. Whatever flavor might have been there was drowned in oil. Couldn't finish it as it was making me feel ill."
Greasy and disappointing,2024-12-18,2,"I had high hopes based on the reviews, but my pizza was swimming in grease. The crust was undercooked in the center, and the promised 'fresh vegetables' looked and tasted canned. Such a letdown."
Pizza arrived upside-down,2024-11-04,1,Delivery driver must have taken a sharp turn because our pizza arrived completely flipped over in the box - all toppings stuck to the lid. Restaurant offered no solution other than suggesting we 'scrape it off and reassemble it.'
All style no substance,2023-11-02,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."
Tasteless cheese substitute,2025-03-20,2,"Their vegan cheese option was terrible - had no meltability, a grainy texture, and tasted strongly of coconut which clashed with the tomato sauce. If you can't do vegan cheese well, better to offer cheese-free options that are properly balanced."
Authentic coal-fired perfection,2023-09-15,5,Their coal-fired oven gives the pizza a distinctive char and smoky flavor that's impossible to replicate any other way. The slight bitterness of the charred spots perfectly balances the sweetness of the sauce.
Too noisy for conversation,2024-10-02,3,The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option.
Undercooked in the middle,2025-03-05,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."
Lackluster veggie options,2023-08-04,3,"Their vegetable toppings lacked freshness and flavor - the mushrooms were clearly canned, the peppers were soft and faded, and the onions were sparse. Disappointing for a place that advertises farm-fresh ingredients."
Exceptional spinach ricotta pie,2023-02-20,5,Their white pizza with spinach and ricotta is exceptional - the creamy richness of the cheese balanced by the slight bitterness of the greens. The garlic-infused olive oil base ties everything together perfectly.
Underwhelming and basic,2023-10-12,3,"Nothing particularly wrong with it, but nothing memorable either. Standard crust, standard sauce, standard toppings. In a city with so many pizza options, this place doesn't give you any reason to return."
Undercooked in the middle,2023-02-16,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."

Skimpy on toppings,2023-01-03,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."
Dirty restaurant,2023-04-09,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."
Absurdly small slices,2024-12-03,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."
Sauce like ketchup,2023-09-23,2,"The sauce was suspiciously sweet and one-dimensional, reminiscent of ketchup rather than a proper pizza sauce. No evidence of herbs, garlic, or any complexity. Ruined what otherwise could have been a decent pizza."
Toppings slide right off,2025-03-30,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2024-02-03,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."

False advertising on size,2024-09-24,2,"Their menu clearly states that a large pizza is 16 inches, but what we received couldn't have been more than 14 inches. When questioned, they claimed their menu was outdated but refused any adjustment."
Best pizza in town,2025-05-10,5,"The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Their signature pepperoni pizza had the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, and the pepperoni curled up into little cups of deliciousness. Will definitely be back!"
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2023-10-05,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."
Innovative flavor combinations,2024-06-05,5,"Their 'Avant Garde' menu section features combinations I would never have thought of but somehow work perfectly. The pear, gorgonzola, walnut, and honey pizza was a revelation of sweet, salty, and savory harmony."
Perfect ingredient distribution,2024-02-14,5,"Every bite had the perfect combination of ingredients - no barren spots, no overwhelming clumps. The toppings were distributed with such precision it almost seemed measured. The mark of true professionals!"
Best white pizza ever,2024-12-18,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"
Excellent for takeout,2025-06-06,4,"Their pizza travels remarkably well. Even after a 20-minute drive home, the crust was still crispy and everything was at the perfect temperature. They have their packaging technique down to a science."

Painfully obvious cheap ingredients,2023-12-12,2,"The pre-shredded cheese didn't melt properly, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the sausage had that distinctive processed flavor. At these prices, cutting corners on ingredients is inexcusable."

Masterclass in proper baking,2023-12-18,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
Undercooked in the middle,2023-01-16,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."
Bland sauce needs work,2023-09-07,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
Innovative flavor combinations,2023-09-09,5,"Their 'Avant Garde' menu section features combinations I would never have thought of but somehow work perfectly. The pear, gorgonzola, walnut, and honey pizza was a revelation of sweet, salty, and savory harmony."

Too much emphasis on appearance,2023-02-09,3,"The pizza was clearly designed to look good in photos - perfect symmetry, vibrant colors, photogenic cheese pull - but the flavor was underwhelming. Style over substance for the Instagram crowd."
Painfully obvious cheap ingredients,2024-04-29,2,"The pre-shredded cheese didn't melt properly, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the sausage had that distinctive processed flavor. At these prices, cutting corners on ingredients is inexcusable."
Too much cornmeal,2024-07-01,3,"They use cornmeal on the bottom of the crust to prevent sticking, which is standard, but they use so much that it's like eating pizza on a sandpaper surface. Gritty texture overwhelms the experience."
Not enough cheese,2023-07-18,3,"The sauce and crust were good, but they're stingy with cheese. You could see the sauce through the sparse cheese layer, and what was there didn't have that stretchy pull you want from a good pizza."
Supreme quality control,2023-12-08,5,"Visited multiple times and the consistency is impressive - every pizza comes out identical to the last one, with the same excellent quality. Shows serious commitment to training and standards that's rare in casual dining."
Perfect ingredient distribution,2024-06-04,5,"Every bite had the perfect combination of ingredients - no barren spots, no overwhelming clumps. The toppings were distributed with such precision it almost seemed measured. The mark of true professionals!"
Perfect for big groups,2023-09-22,5,"We had a party of 12 and they accommodated us perfectly. Their 20-inch shareable pizzas are great for groups, and they were happy to do half-and-half toppings to please everyone. Service was impressively coordinated."
Absurdly small slices,2023-12-08,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."
Too noisy for conversation,2024-01-14,3,The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option.
Stale-tasting crust,2024-06-17,2,"The crust had a stale, almost cardboard-like quality that suggests either old dough or old flour. Fresh ingredients on top couldn't compensate for the foundation being off."
Absurdly small slices,2025-02-05,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."
Perfect for picky eaters,2024-08-01,4,Their 'build your own quarter' option is genius - a large pizza divided into quadrants with different toppings. Perfect for our family where everyone wants something different. No more ordering multiple pizzas!
Terrible delivery experience,2024-08-27,1,"Ordered for Valentine's Day and regretted it. Pizza took 2 hours to arrive, was cold, and had the wrong toppings. Called the restaurant and they seemed completely unconcerned. Never again."
Righteous ranch drizzle,2024-03-14,5,Their house-made ranch drizzle takes their pizzas to another level. It's not your typical ranch - has hints of dill and garlic with a perfect consistency that adds creaminess without making things soggy.
Too much cornmeal,2025-06-21,3,"They use cornmeal on the bottom of the crust to prevent sticking, which is standard, but they use so much that it's like eating pizza on a sandpaper surface. Gritty texture overwhelms the experience."
Unmelted cheese in the center,2025-01-04,2,"The edges were fine but the center had cold, unmelted cheese - a sign the oven wasn't hot enough or the pizza wasn't cooked long enough. Basic pizza fundamentals seem to be lacking."
False advertising on size,2024-02-18,2,"Their menu clearly states that a large pizza is 16 inches, but what we received couldn't have been more than 14 inches. When questioned, they claimed their menu was outdated but refused any adjustment."
Way too much oregano,2024-02-10,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
Supreme quality control,2024-12-06,5,"Visited multiple times and the consistency is impressive - every pizza comes out identical to the last one, with the same excellent quality. Shows serious commitment to training and standards that's rare in casual dining."
Perfect balance of flavors,2024-05-12,5,"Their 'Mediterranean' pizza has the perfect balance of flavors - the briny olives, tangy feta, fresh tomatoes, and herb-infused olive oil all complement each other without any one element overwhelming the others."
Magnificent flavor layering,2025-05-28,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Burnt crust ruins it,2024-07-12,2,"They claim 'char' is part of the Neapolitan experience, but there's a difference between char and burnt. The entire bottom of my pizza was black and bitter. Scraping it off meant losing half the crust."
Perfect NY-style slices,2025-02-04,5,"As a transplant from NYC, I've been searching for authentic NY-style pizza. This place nails it - thin, foldable slices with the right amount of chew and grease. Their plain cheese slice is perfection."
Refrigerated dough taste,2024-05-28,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."
Dirty restaurant,2024-10-07,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2025-02-21,5,They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!
Innovative flavor combinations,2025-05-01,5,"Their 'Avant Garde' menu section features combinations I would never have thought of but somehow work perfectly. The pear, gorgonzola, walnut, and honey pizza was a revelation of sweet, salty, and savory harmony."
Too greasy to enjoy,2025-06-06,2,"Had to literally blot my pizza with napkins, which came away completely saturated with grease. Whatever flavor might have been there was drowned in oil. Couldn't finish it as it was making me feel ill."
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2025-02-25,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Burned bottom raw top,2024-10-24,1,The bottom of the crust was completely black while the cheese on top wasn't fully melted. This temperature imbalance suggests serious issues with their oven management and pizza-making technique.
Crust like cardboard,2024-04-18,2,"The crust had all the flavor and texture of packing material - dry, tough, and completely devoid of character. Even the decent toppings couldn't save it. The foundation of good pizza is good dough, and this wasn't it."
Supreme quality control,2024-01-29,5,"Visited multiple times and the consistency is impressive - every pizza comes out identical to the last one, with the same excellent quality. Shows serious commitment to training and standards that's rare in casual dining."
Superior ingredients make the difference,2023-02-28,5,"They import their flour from Italy, use San Marzano tomatoes, and make their mozzarella in-house daily. The commitment to quality ingredients is evident in every bite - nothing is an afterthought."
Innovative toppings,2024-09-20,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."
Perfect NY-style slices,2024-04-10,5,"As a transplant from NYC, I've been searching for authentic NY-style pizza. This place nails it - thin, foldable slices with the right amount of chew and grease. Their plain cheese slice is perfection."
Perfect buffalo mozzarella application,2023-03-05,5,They understand that buffalo mozzarella shouldn't be cooked too long or it loses its distinctive texture and flavor. Applied in dollops after the pizza is mostly baked so it just barely melts while maintaining its creamy integrity. Technical perfection!
Pizza barely survived the drive home,2024-06-05,2,"Ordered takeout and by the time I got home (15 minutes), the pizza was a soggy mess. They clearly don't use appropriate packaging for takeout - no vents to release steam means the crust steams itself into sogginess."
Perfect for big groups,2024-03-19,5,"We had a party of 12 and they accommodated us perfectly. Their 20-inch shareable pizzas are great for groups, and they were happy to do half-and-half toppings to please everyone. Service was impressively coordinated."
Too much sauce,2024-12-16,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Brilliant use of fermented dough,2024-12-30,5,Their 72-hour fermented dough has incredible depth of flavor with subtle sourdough notes. The extended fermentation creates a complex web of flavors and perfect texture that you simply can't achieve with quick-rise methods.
Perfect crunch factor,2023-03-11,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."
Cheese solidified too quickly,2023-07-23,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Great gluten-free option,2023-07-10,4,"As someone with celiac disease, finding good gluten-free pizza is a challenge. Their cauliflower crust was one of the best I've had - doesn't fall apart and has a nice flavor. Toppings were generous too."
Not worth the wait,2024-10-28,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."
Crispy yet chewy perfection,2023-03-05,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."
Lackluster veggie options,2025-06-09,3,"Their vegetable toppings lacked freshness and flavor - the mushrooms were clearly canned, the peppers were soft and faded, and the onions were sparse. Disappointing for a place that advertises farm-fresh ingredients."
Perfect pepperoni placement,2023-09-08,5,"As a pepperoni perfectionist, I appreciate that they space the pepperoni so every bite gets one full piece. No bare spots or clumped areas. Shows attention to detail that elevates the whole experience."
Refrigerated dough taste,2025-06-22,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."
Pizza barely survived the drive home,2023-01-23,2,"Ordered takeout and by the time I got home (15 minutes), the pizza was a soggy mess. They clearly don't use appropriate packaging for takeout - no vents to release steam means the crust steams itself into sogginess."
Perfect balance of flavors,2024-02-17,5,"Their 'Mediterranean' pizza has the perfect balance of flavors - the briny olives, tangy feta, fresh tomatoes, and herb-infused olive oil all complement each other without any one element overwhelming the others."
All style no substance,2024-08-05,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."
Family night favorite,2024-03-07,5,"We bring our kids here every Friday night. The staff always make them feel special, providing dough for them to play with while we wait. Their kid-sized pizzas are perfect, and the parents love the craft beer selection."

Not enough cheese,2025-03-20,3,"The sauce and crust were good, but they're stingy with cheese. You could see the sauce through the sparse cheese layer, and what was there didn't have that stretchy pull you want from a good pizza."
Incredible vodka sauce base,2024-01-03,5,"Their vodka sauce pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil is something special. The creamy, slightly spicy sauce is a perfect alternative to traditional tomato sauce. Add prosciutto for an extra flavor dimension!"
Underwhelming and basic,2023-09-21,3,"Nothing particularly wrong with it, but nothing memorable either. Standard crust, standard sauce, standard toppings. In a city with so many pizza options, this place doesn't give you any reason to return."
Sloppy presentation,2024-03-21,3,"The pizza looked like it had been assembled in a hurry - toppings haphazardly thrown on, cheese unevenly distributed, and the cutting was so uneven that some slices were twice the size of others. Taste was okay, but appearance matters too."
Perfect NY-style slices,2025-06-09,5,"As a transplant from NYC, I've been searching for authentic NY-style pizza. This place nails it - thin, foldable slices with the right amount of chew and grease. Their plain cheese slice is perfection."
Excellence in simplicity,2024-11-30,5,"Their classic Margherita showcases their commitment to quality - the balance of sweet-acidic tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella, fragrant basil, and that perfectly chewy-crisp crust. Proof that simple can be sublime."
Masterclass in proper baking,2024-11-06,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
Cold center burnt edges,2023-04-30,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Dirty restaurant,2023-11-07,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."

No-cheese option was all sauce,2023-09-19,2,"Ordered a cheese-free pizza for my dairy-allergic friend, but they made no adjustments - just removed the cheese and left a soggy sauce-covered bread. Good pizza without cheese requires rebalancing other elements."
Weird aftertaste,2024-08-22,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."
Excellent attention to cooking time,2023-04-24,5,They nail the cooking time perfectly - pulling the pizza from the oven at exactly the right moment when the cheese is fully melted and bubbling but not yet browned. Shows expertise and attention to detail.
Skimpy on toppings,2023-09-05,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."
Lackluster veggie options,2024-12-27,3,"Their vegetable toppings lacked freshness and flavor - the mushrooms were clearly canned, the peppers were soft and faded, and the onions were sparse. Disappointing for a place that advertises farm-fresh ingredients."
Too thin to be satisfying,2023-06-02,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Dirty restaurant,2024-02-12,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."
Perfect thin crust,2023-02-11,5,"If you're a thin crust fan, this is your place. Cracker-thin, crispy all the way through, yet somehow still has a nice chew. Their simple cheese pizza showcases their excellent sauce - slightly sweet with a nice herb blend."
Masterclass in proper baking,2024-04-22,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
Cheese solidified too quickly,2025-02-02,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Exceptional spinach ricotta pie,2025-01-28,5,Their white pizza with spinach and ricotta is exceptional - the creamy richness of the cheese balanced by the slight bitterness of the greens. The garlic-infused olive oil base ties everything together perfectly.
Mediocre at best,2024-07-27,3,"Nothing terrible but nothing special either. The crust was okay, toppings were standard, and service was fine. It's the kind of place you go when you're in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip for."
Excessive grease pooling,2025-03-12,2,"Had to continuously blot the pizza with napkins as pools of orange grease formed on top of the cheese with every passing minute. By the end, the napkins were completely saturated and transparent. Felt unhealthy even by pizza standards."
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2024-09-17,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Best white pizza ever,2024-04-28,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"
Exceptional sauce-making technique,2025-01-05,5,"You can tell their sauce is made with properly hand-crushed tomatoes - it has that perfect texture with small chunks rather than being completely smooth. The bright flavor suggests minimal cooking, allowing the tomato quality to shine."
False advertising on size,2023-07-26,2,"Their menu clearly states that a large pizza is 16 inches, but what we received couldn't have been more than 14 inches. When questioned, they claimed their menu was outdated but refused any adjustment."
Refrigerated dough taste,2025-01-07,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."
Stale-tasting crust,2024-06-03,2,"The crust had a stale, almost cardboard-like quality that suggests either old dough or old flour. Fresh ingredients on top couldn't compensate for the foundation being off."
Authentic coal-fired perfection,2023-02-25,5,Their coal-fired oven gives the pizza a distinctive char and smoky flavor that's impossible to replicate any other way. The slight bitterness of the charred spots perfectly balances the sweetness of the sauce.
Authentic coal-fired perfection,2023-07-19,5,Their coal-fired oven gives the pizza a distinctive char and smoky flavor that's impossible to replicate any other way. The slight bitterness of the charred spots perfectly balances the sweetness of the sauce.
Bland sauce needs work,2023-11-12,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
Burnt crust ruins it,2024-01-11,2,"They claim 'char' is part of the Neapolitan experience, but there's a difference between char and burnt. The entire bottom of my pizza was black and bitter. Scraping it off meant losing half the crust."
Perfect for lunch specials,2023-09-23,4,"Their lunch deal is unbeatable - $10 for a 10-inch pizza and small salad. The pizza comes out quickly, is always fresh, and the perfect size for one person. Great place for a work lunch."
Dirty restaurant,2024-07-02,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."
Perfect for watching sports,2025-04-15,4,"Great setup with TVs visible from every table, excellent pitcher specials during games, and their 'Game Day' pizza loaded with multiple meats and jalapeños is the perfect sports-watching food. Atmosphere gets lively but not obnoxious."
Innovative toppings,2024-05-06,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."

Terrible delivery experience,2024-03-04,1,"Ordered for Valentine's Day and regretted it. Pizza took 2 hours to arrive, was cold, and had the wrong toppings. Called the restaurant and they seemed completely unconcerned. Never again."
Perfect textural contrast,2024-01-01,5,"The contrast between the crisp bottom, the tender interior crumb, the gooey cheese, and the slight resistance of the toppings creates a textural symphony. Each bite is interesting and satisfying in a different way."
Spicy special was too much,2024-02-15,2,Their 'Firebreather' pizza should come with a warning label. It wasn't enjoyably spicy - it was painfully hot to the point where I couldn't taste anything else. Had to throw most of it away.
All style no substance,2023-12-21,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2023-04-15,5,They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!
Too much cornmeal,2023-12-23,3,"They use cornmeal on the bottom of the crust to prevent sticking, which is standard, but they use so much that it's like eating pizza on a sandpaper surface. Gritty texture overwhelms the experience."

Perfect textural contrast,2024-11-06,5,"The contrast between the crisp bottom, the tender interior crumb, the gooey cheese, and the slight resistance of the toppings creates a textural symphony. Each bite is interesting and satisfying in a different way."
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2023-12-18,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."
Way too much crust,2024-04-03,2,The edge crust (cornicione) was comically large - almost half of each slice was just bread with no toppings. This ratio of crust to actual pizza was way off and made for a disappointing experience.
Too much emphasis on appearance,2024-05-02,3,"The pizza was clearly designed to look good in photos - perfect symmetry, vibrant colors, photogenic cheese pull - but the flavor was underwhelming. Style over substance for the Instagram crowd."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2025-06-15,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Excellent Chicago deep dish,2024-02-06,5,"Hard to find authentic Chicago-style pizza in this area, but they nail it. The buttery, flaky crust, the layering of cheese under the sauce, the chunky tomato topping - all perfect. Worth the 45-minute cook time."
Bland sauce needs work,2023-06-03,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
Brilliant seasonal rotation,2023-06-18,5,"Love that they have a rotating seasonal pizza that showcases what's fresh. The current spring offering with asparagus, green garlic, and fresh peas is bright and delicious - a perfect reflection of the season."
Perfect NY-style slices,2025-03-04,5,"As a transplant from NYC, I've been searching for authentic NY-style pizza. This place nails it - thin, foldable slices with the right amount of chew and grease. Their plain cheese slice is perfection."
Perfect temperature every time,2023-02-18,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
Perfect for dietary restrictions,2024-04-17,5,"As someone with multiple food allergies, I appreciate that they take dietary concerns seriously. Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"
Tough leathery crust,2024-09-18,2,"The crust was so tough I almost couldn't bite through it - like trying to eat leather. The edges were particularly problematic, had to tear pieces off with significant effort. Completely lacks the pleasant chewiness good pizza should have."
Cold center burnt edges,2024-12-16,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Perfect for big groups,2023-03-19,5,"We had a party of 12 and they accommodated us perfectly. Their 20-inch shareable pizzas are great for groups, and they were happy to do half-and-half toppings to please everyone. Service was impressively coordinated."
Too expensive for pizza,2025-02-11,3,"The pizza is good, I'll give them that. But $30 for a basic large cheese pizza is highway robbery. Add toppings and you're looking at $40-50. The quality doesn't justify these premium prices."
Family night favorite,2023-05-09,5,"We bring our kids here every Friday night. The staff always make them feel special, providing dough for them to play with while we wait. Their kid-sized pizzas are perfect, and the parents love the craft beer selection."
Innovative toppings,2023-11-09,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."
Greasy and disappointing,2025-02-26,2,"I had high hopes based on the reviews, but my pizza was swimming in grease. The crust was undercooked in the center, and the promised 'fresh vegetables' looked and tasted canned. Such a letdown."
Excellent attention to cooking time,2023-02-13,5,They nail the cooking time perfectly - pulling the pizza from the oven at exactly the right moment when the cheese is fully melted and bubbling but not yet browned. Shows expertise and attention to detail.

Righteous ranch drizzle,2024-01-03,5,Their house-made ranch drizzle takes their pizzas to another level. It's not your typical ranch - has hints of dill and garlic with a perfect consistency that adds creaminess without making things soggy.
Perfect for big groups,2024-11-24,5,"We had a party of 12 and they accommodated us perfectly. Their 20-inch shareable pizzas are great for groups, and they were happy to do half-and-half toppings to please everyone. Service was impressively coordinated."

Excellent beer pairing suggestions,2024-09-01,5,"Not only is their pizza excellent (try the fig and prosciutto!), but the staff is knowledgeable about their craft beer selection and can suggest the perfect pairing for whatever pizza you order."
Outstanding breakfast pizza,2024-09-03,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
Perfect for dietary restrictions,2025-02-24,5,"As someone with multiple food allergies, I appreciate that they take dietary concerns seriously. Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"
Perfect for watching sports,2025-05-20,4,"Great setup with TVs visible from every table, excellent pitcher specials during games, and their 'Game Day' pizza loaded with multiple meats and jalapeños is the perfect sports-watching food. Atmosphere gets lively but not obnoxious."
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2023-10-04,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Perfect for late-night cravings,2024-08-30,5,"Open until 3am on weekends, this place has saved many late nights. The slices are huge, they reheat them perfectly so they're crispy, and their special late-night menu items are creative and delicious."
Supreme quality control,2023-03-10,5,"Visited multiple times and the consistency is impressive - every pizza comes out identical to the last one, with the same excellent quality. Shows serious commitment to training and standards that's rare in casual dining."
Too much salt in the dough,2023-12-03,2,The crust was so salty it was almost inedible - overwhelmed all the other flavors and left me incredibly thirsty afterward. A heavy hand with salt ruined what could have been a good pizza.
Bland sauce needs work,2024-05-01,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
Cheese solidified too quickly,2024-05-10,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Crispy yet chewy perfection,2023-02-24,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."
Skimpy on toppings,2024-02-09,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."
Authentic Italian experience,2025-02-22,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
Unmelted cheese in the center,2024-08-07,2,"The edges were fine but the center had cold, unmelted cheese - a sign the oven wasn't hot enough or the pizza wasn't cooked long enough. Basic pizza fundamentals seem to be lacking."
Not worth the wait,2023-12-06,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."
Perfect crunch factor,2025-04-07,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2024-03-03,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Perfect crust-to-topping ratio,2024-07-23,5,"Some places overload toppings so the crust gets soggy, others are too sparse. This place gets it perfect - enough toppings to get some in every bite, but not so much that the structural integrity is compromised."
Way too much oregano,2024-07-02,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
Too much emphasis on appearance,2024-04-13,3,"The pizza was clearly designed to look good in photos - perfect symmetry, vibrant colors, photogenic cheese pull - but the flavor was underwhelming. Style over substance for the Instagram crowd."
Disappointed with service,2023-11-25,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."
Too much sauce,2024-10-19,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2025-03-18,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
No-cheese option was all sauce,2023-06-15,2,"Ordered a cheese-free pizza for my dairy-allergic friend, but they made no adjustments - just removed the cheese and left a soggy sauce-covered bread. Good pizza without cheese requires rebalancing other elements."
Amazing Detroit-style,2023-09-22,5,"Their Detroit-style square pizza is incredible - crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior, and those corner pieces are to die for! The pepperoni cup and char perfectly. Worth the 30-minute wait."
Disappointed with service,2023-04-16,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."
Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2024-08-03,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies. The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."
New owners ruined it,2023-02-21,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."
Burned bottom raw top,2023-04-28,1,The bottom of the crust was completely black while the cheese on top wasn't fully melted. This temperature imbalance suggests serious issues with their oven management and pizza-making technique.
Disappointed with service,2025-06-11,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."
Too much cheese,2024-01-07,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Perfect for lunch specials,2024-07-08,4,"Their lunch deal is unbeatable - $10 for a 10-inch pizza and small salad. The pizza comes out quickly, is always fresh, and the perfect size for one person. Great place for a work lunch."
Excellent customer service,2024-06-16,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
Skimpy on toppings,2023-11-23,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."
Disappointed with service,2024-10-31,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."
Spicy special was too much,2023-10-31,2,Their 'Firebreather' pizza should come with a warning label. It wasn't enjoyably spicy - it was painfully hot to the point where I couldn't taste anything else. Had to throw most of it away.
Magnificent flavor layering,2025-06-30,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Undercooked in the middle,2024-10-31,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."
Great gluten-free option,2024-08-22,4,"As someone with celiac disease, finding good gluten-free pizza is a challenge. Their cauliflower crust was one of the best I've had - doesn't fall apart and has a nice flavor. Toppings were generous too."
Best pizza in town,2024-10-10,5,"The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Their signature pepperoni pizza had the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, and the pepperoni curled up into little cups of deliciousness. Will definitely be back!"
Toppings slide right off,2024-11-07,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Tiny portion sizes,2025-04-25,2,"Their 'personal' pizza is the size of a CD. For $15, I expected something that would actually satisfy my hunger. Had to order a second one, turning a quick lunch into an expensive disappointment."
Way too much oregano,2024-03-03,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."

Family night favorite,2024-02-02,5,"We bring our kids here every Friday night. The staff always make them feel special, providing dough for them to play with while we wait. Their kid-sized pizzas are perfect, and the parents love the craft beer selection."
Amazing Detroit-style,2023-09-23,5,"Their Detroit-style square pizza is incredible - crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior, and those corner pieces are to die for! The pepperoni cup and char perfectly. Worth the 30-minute wait."
Too much garlic,2024-05-09,3,"I love garlic but this was excessive - felt like they mistook cloves for teaspoons in the recipe. My breath was lethal afterward, and the powerful flavor overwhelmed the other ingredients."
Incredible vodka sauce base,2024-04-11,5,"Their vodka sauce pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil is something special. The creamy, slightly spicy sauce is a perfect alternative to traditional tomato sauce. Add prosciutto for an extra flavor dimension!"
Innovative toppings,2024-03-27,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."
Absurdly small slices,2024-04-29,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."
Excellence in simplicity,2025-05-05,5,"Their classic Margherita showcases their commitment to quality - the balance of sweet-acidic tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella, fragrant basil, and that perfectly chewy-crisp crust. Proof that simple can be sublime."

Best pizza in town,2023-06-15,5,"The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Their signature pepperoni pizza had the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, and the pepperoni curled up into little cups of deliciousness. Will definitely be back!"
Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2025-03-08,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
Burnt crust ruins it,2025-02-21,2,"They claim 'char' is part of the Neapolitan experience, but there's a difference between char and burnt. The entire bottom of my pizza was black and bitter. Scraping it off meant losing half the crust."
Perfect crunch factor,2023-08-01,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."
Crispy yet chewy perfection,2023-04-28,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."

Crust like cardboard,2023-12-17,2,"The crust had all the flavor and texture of packing material - dry, tough, and completely devoid of character. Even the decent toppings couldn't save it. The foundation of good pizza is good dough, and this wasn't it."
Too thin to be satisfying,2023-08-24,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Sauce like ketchup,2023-12-20,2,"The sauce was suspiciously sweet and one-dimensional, reminiscent of ketchup rather than a proper pizza sauce. No evidence of herbs, garlic, or any complexity. Ruined what otherwise could have been a decent pizza."
Too much cheese,2023-03-07,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Late night savior,2023-08-20,4,"Open until 2am on weekends, this place has saved me many times after a night out. Their slices are huge, reheated perfectly crisp, and they have creative toppings that hit the spot when you're hungry late at night."
Outstanding wood-fired perfection,2025-02-25,5,The wood-fired oven gives their pizza a distinctive smoky complexity you can't get any other way. The slight char adds bitterness that balances the sweetness of the sauce perfectly. Worth seeking out for this unique flavor profile.
Overpriced for what you get,2025-02-24,3,"$24 for a medium pizza with just two toppings seems excessive. The ingredients were fresh and the crust was good, but nothing justified the premium price. There are better values elsewhere in town."
Not enough cheese,2024-02-18,3,"The sauce and crust were good, but they're stingy with cheese. You could see the sauce through the sparse cheese layer, and what was there didn't have that stretchy pull you want from a good pizza."
Cheese solidified too quickly,2023-01-31,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Creative seasonal specials,2025-05-21,5,"Just had their spring special with asparagus, lemon ricotta, and prosciutto. The combination was bright, fresh, and perfect for the season. Love that they use local, seasonal ingredients."
Perfect ingredient distribution,2023-01-12,5,"Every bite had the perfect combination of ingredients - no barren spots, no overwhelming clumps. The toppings were distributed with such precision it almost seemed measured. The mark of true professionals!"
Too much sauce,2023-12-23,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."

Magnificent flavor layering,2024-02-17,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Perfect for big groups,2023-10-09,5,"We had a party of 12 and they accommodated us perfectly. Their 20-inch shareable pizzas are great for groups, and they were happy to do half-and-half toppings to please everyone. Service was impressively coordinated."
Masterclass in proper baking,2025-06-29,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
Doughy and undercooked,2023-12-03,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Perfect for picky eaters,2024-12-24,4,Their 'build your own quarter' option is genius - a large pizza divided into quadrants with different toppings. Perfect for our family where everyone wants something different. No more ordering multiple pizzas!
Masterful use of olive oil,2023-04-26,5,"The drizzle of high-quality olive oil they add just before serving makes all the difference - adds richness, enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, and adds a wonderful aromatic element. Simple but transformative."
Magnificent flavor layering,2024-03-08,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Lackluster veggie options,2025-07-01,3,"Their vegetable toppings lacked freshness and flavor - the mushrooms were clearly canned, the peppers were soft and faded, and the onions were sparse. Disappointing for a place that advertises farm-fresh ingredients."
False advertising on size,2023-10-15,2,"Their menu clearly states that a large pizza is 16 inches, but what we received couldn't have been more than 14 inches. When questioned, they claimed their menu was outdated but refused any adjustment."
Crust like cardboard,2023-11-30,2,"The crust had all the flavor and texture of packing material - dry, tough, and completely devoid of character. Even the decent toppings couldn't save it. The foundation of good pizza is good dough, and this wasn't it."
False advertising on ingredients,2024-12-29,1,"Menu promised 'house-made Italian sausage' but what came on my pizza was clearly pre-formed, uniform pellets of commercial sausage. When questioned, staff admitted they don't make any ingredients in-house despite menu claims."
Tough leathery crust,2023-03-26,2,"The crust was so tough I almost couldn't bite through it - like trying to eat leather. The edges were particularly problematic, had to tear pieces off with significant effort. Completely lacks the pleasant chewiness good pizza should have."
Incredible vodka sauce base,2024-10-22,5,"Their vodka sauce pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil is something special. The creamy, slightly spicy sauce is a perfect alternative to traditional tomato sauce. Add prosciutto for an extra flavor dimension!"
Phenomenal crust,2024-05-24,5,"Whatever they do to their dough is magical - it's got that perfect combination of crispy and chewy with a slight sourdough tang. I could eat their plain crust by itself, it's that good."
Disappointed with service,2025-03-04,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."
Skimpy on toppings,2023-10-10,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."
Great gluten-free option,2024-05-13,4,"As someone with celiac disease, finding good gluten-free pizza is a challenge. Their cauliflower crust was one of the best I've had - doesn't fall apart and has a nice flavor. Toppings were generous too."
Outstanding variety of options,2025-06-18,5,"Their menu has something for everyone - traditional options done well, creative specialties, and customizable choices. Even have dessert pizzas that are surprisingly good (try the Nutella and banana!)."
Magnificent flavor layering,2024-01-25,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
No flavor distinction,2023-07-21,3,Ordered two completely different specialty pizzas but they somehow tasted nearly identical. It's like they use the same base for everything and the toppings don't impart enough distinctive character.
Late night savior,2023-08-02,4,"Open until 2am on weekends, this place has saved me many times after a night out. Their slices are huge, reheated perfectly crisp, and they have creative toppings that hit the spot when you're hungry late at night."
Best Hawaiian in the city,2024-05-28,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."
Pizza arrived upside-down,2023-11-01,1,Delivery driver must have taken a sharp turn because our pizza arrived completely flipped over in the box - all toppings stuck to the lid. Restaurant offered no solution other than suggesting we 'scrape it off and reassemble it.'
Perfect for lunch specials,2023-09-16,4,"Their lunch deal is unbeatable - $10 for a 10-inch pizza and small salad. The pizza comes out quickly, is always fresh, and the perfect size for one person. Great place for a work lunch."

Too salty,2025-02-14,2,"Everything I tried was oversalted - the crust, the sauce, and especially the cheese. It was like they were trying to ensure you'd order more drinks. Couldn't finish my pizza and was thirsty all night."
Too expensive for pizza,2024-12-13,3,"The pizza is good, I'll give them that. But $30 for a basic large cheese pizza is highway robbery. Add toppings and you're looking at $40-50. The quality doesn't justify these premium prices."
Perfect NY-style slices,2023-04-11,5,"As a transplant from NYC, I've been searching for authentic NY-style pizza. This place nails it - thin, foldable slices with the right amount of chew and grease. Their plain cheese slice is perfection."
Brilliant use of fermented dough,2024-10-29,5,Their 72-hour fermented dough has incredible depth of flavor with subtle sourdough notes. The extended fermentation creates a complex web of flavors and perfect texture that you simply can't achieve with quick-rise methods.
Excellent wine pairings,2024-04-15,5,"Their curated wine list is designed specifically to pair with their pizzas, and the staff is knowledgeable about suggesting the perfect match. The house red with their sausage pizza is a transcendent combination."
Too expensive for pizza,2023-02-23,3,"The pizza is good, I'll give them that. But $30 for a basic large cheese pizza is highway robbery. Add toppings and you're looking at $40-50. The quality doesn't justify these premium prices."

Perfect buffalo mozzarella application,2023-12-28,5,They understand that buffalo mozzarella shouldn't be cooked too long or it loses its distinctive texture and flavor. Applied in dollops after the pizza is mostly baked so it just barely melts while maintaining its creamy integrity. Technical perfection!
Expert-level pizza folding,2025-04-05,5,Their thin-crust slices fold perfectly New York-style without cracking or losing toppings. The slight resistance before the fold is exactly what you want - showing the perfect balance of crisp and chew.
Sauce like ketchup,2025-01-15,2,"The sauce was suspiciously sweet and one-dimensional, reminiscent of ketchup rather than a proper pizza sauce. No evidence of herbs, garlic, or any complexity. Ruined what otherwise could have been a decent pizza."
Pizza barely survived the drive home,2023-01-16,2,"Ordered takeout and by the time I got home (15 minutes), the pizza was a soggy mess. They clearly don't use appropriate packaging for takeout - no vents to release steam means the crust steams itself into sogginess."
Crispy yet chewy perfection,2024-01-14,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."

Spicy special was too much,2023-06-28,2,Their 'Firebreather' pizza should come with a warning label. It wasn't enjoyably spicy - it was painfully hot to the point where I couldn't taste anything else. Had to throw most of it away.

Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"

Excessive grease pooling,2024-01-24,2,"Had to continuously blot the pizza with napkins as pools of orange grease formed on top of the cheese with every passing minute. By the end, the napkins were completely saturated and transparent. Felt unhealthy even by pizza standards."
Too thin to be satisfying,2024-11-22,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Best pizza in town,2025-03-24,5,"The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Their signature pepperoni pizza had the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, and the pepperoni curled up into little cups of deliciousness. Will definitely be back!"
Amazing Detroit-style,2023-08-29,5,"Their Detroit-style square pizza is incredible - crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior, and those corner pieces are to die for! The pepperoni cup and char perfectly. Worth the 30-minute wait."

Not enough cheese,2024-03-04,3,"The sauce and crust were good, but they're stingy with cheese. You could see the sauce through the sparse cheese layer, and what was there didn't have that stretchy pull you want from a good pizza."
Righteous ranch drizzle,2025-06-15,5,Their house-made ranch drizzle takes their pizzas to another level. It's not your typical ranch - has hints of dill and garlic with a perfect consistency that adds creaminess without making things soggy.
Too much cheese,2023-07-09,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Dirty restaurant,2024-05-22,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."
Tough leathery crust,2025-02-21,2,"The crust was so tough I almost couldn't bite through it - like trying to eat leather. The edges were particularly problematic, had to tear pieces off with significant effort. Completely lacks the pleasant chewiness good pizza should have."

Toppings slide right off,2025-01-15,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Excellent attention to cooking time,2025-02-07,5,They nail the cooking time perfectly - pulling the pizza from the oven at exactly the right moment when the cheese is fully melted and bubbling but not yet browned. Shows expertise and attention to detail.
Outstanding breakfast pizza,2024-07-29,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
Magnificent flavor layering,2023-10-12,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Mediocre at best,2024-05-24,3,"Nothing terrible but nothing special either. The crust was okay, toppings were standard, and service was fine. It's the kind of place you go when you're in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip for."
Terrible delivery experience,2023-12-20,1,"Ordered for Valentine's Day and regretted it. Pizza took 2 hours to arrive, was cold, and had the wrong toppings. Called the restaurant and they seemed completely unconcerned. Never again."
Best white pizza ever,2024-01-17,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"
Excessive grease pooling,2023-01-16,2,"Had to continuously blot the pizza with napkins as pools of orange grease formed on top of the cheese with every passing minute. By the end, the napkins were completely saturated and transparent. Felt unhealthy even by pizza standards."
Excellent beer pairing suggestions,2024-08-31,5,"Not only is their pizza excellent (try the fig and prosciutto!), but the staff is knowledgeable about their craft beer selection and can suggest the perfect pairing for whatever pizza you order."
Ideal char-to-chew ratio,2024-01-12,5,The small charred bubbles on the crust add amazing flavor without dominating. They've mastered that balance between the slight bitterness of char and the natural sweetness of the dough. Technical perfection!
Superior ingredients make the difference,2024-08-30,5,"They import their flour from Italy, use San Marzano tomatoes, and make their mozzarella in-house daily. The commitment to quality ingredients is evident in every bite - nothing is an afterthought."
Mediocre at best,2024-10-05,3,"Nothing terrible but nothing special either. The crust was okay, toppings were standard, and service was fine. It's the kind of place you go when you're in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip for."
Underwhelming and basic,2023-12-11,3,"Nothing particularly wrong with it, but nothing memorable either. Standard crust, standard sauce, standard toppings. In a city with so many pizza options, this place doesn't give you any reason to return."
Disappointed with service,2024-05-02,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."
Masterclass in proper baking,2023-10-22,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
Too much cornmeal,2024-12-11,3,"They use cornmeal on the bottom of the crust to prevent sticking, which is standard, but they use so much that it's like eating pizza on a sandpaper surface. Gritty texture overwhelms the experience."
Hidden gem for vegans,2023-10-21,5,"I can't believe how good their vegan pizza is! They make their own cashew cheese that actually melts properly, and their vegetable toppings are always fresh and seasonal. Even my non-vegan friends love it."
Family night favorite,2024-12-05,5,"We bring our kids here every Friday night. The staff always make them feel special, providing dough for them to play with while we wait. Their kid-sized pizzas are perfect, and the parents love the craft beer selection."
Inconsistent quality,2025-02-13,3,I've been here three times. First visit: amazing. Second: terrible. Third: just okay. Seems like it really depends on who's working that day. Wish they could maintain better quality control.
Doughy and undercooked,2024-03-24,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Perfect for dietary restrictions,2024-08-31,5,"As someone with multiple food allergies, I appreciate that they take dietary concerns seriously. Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"
Spicy special was too much,2023-05-22,2,Their 'Firebreather' pizza should come with a warning label. It wasn't enjoyably spicy - it was painfully hot to the point where I couldn't taste anything else. Had to throw most of it away.
Absurdly small slices,2024-06-13,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."
Way too much oregano,2024-04-10,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
Weird aftertaste,2024-09-15,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."
Perfect NY-style slices,2023-02-27,5,"As a transplant from NYC, I've been searching for authentic NY-style pizza. This place nails it - thin, foldable slices with the right amount of chew and grease. Their plain cheese slice is perfection."
Toppings slide right off,2023-03-10,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.

Outstanding breakfast pizza,2025-02-24,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2024-03-23,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
Spicy special was too much,2025-05-31,2,Their 'Firebreather' pizza should come with a warning label. It wasn't enjoyably spicy - it was painfully hot to the point where I couldn't taste anything else. Had to throw most of it away.
Burned bottom raw top,2024-04-16,1,The bottom of the crust was completely black while the cheese on top wasn't fully melted. This temperature imbalance suggests serious issues with their oven management and pizza-making technique.
Mediocre at best,2024-05-07,3,"Nothing terrible but nothing special either. The crust was okay, toppings were standard, and service was fine. It's the kind of place you go when you're in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip for."
Cheese solidified too quickly,2023-10-12,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Burned bottom raw top,2024-10-18,1,The bottom of the crust was completely black while the cheese on top wasn't fully melted. This temperature imbalance suggests serious issues with their oven management and pizza-making technique.
Pizza barely survived the drive home,2023-06-09,2,"Ordered takeout and by the time I got home (15 minutes), the pizza was a soggy mess. They clearly don't use appropriate packaging for takeout - no vents to release steam means the crust steams itself into sogginess."
Perfect NY-style slices,2025-04-02,5,"As a transplant from NYC, I've been searching for authentic NY-style pizza. This place nails it - thin, foldable slices with the right amount of chew and grease. Their plain cheese slice is perfection."
Pizza barely survived the drive home,2024-04-19,2,"Ordered takeout and by the time I got home (15 minutes), the pizza was a soggy mess. They clearly don't use appropriate packaging for takeout - no vents to release steam means the crust steams itself into sogginess."
Best pizza in town,2024-01-13,5,"The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Their signature pepperoni pizza had the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, and the pepperoni curled up into little cups of deliciousness. Will definitely be back!"
Excellent Chicago deep dish,2024-09-06,5,"Hard to find authentic Chicago-style pizza in this area, but they nail it. The buttery, flaky crust, the layering of cheese under the sauce, the chunky tomato topping - all perfect. Worth the 45-minute cook time."
Not enough cheese,2025-06-09,3,"The sauce and crust were good, but they're stingy with cheese. You could see the sauce through the sparse cheese layer, and what was there didn't have that stretchy pull you want from a good pizza."
Too much cheese,2024-08-15,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."

Amazing Detroit-style,2024-03-21,5,"Their Detroit-style square pizza is incredible - crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior, and those corner pieces are to die for! The pepperoni cup and char perfectly. Worth the 30-minute wait."
Not enough cheese,2023-02-11,3,"The sauce and crust were good, but they're stingy with cheese. You could see the sauce through the sparse cheese layer, and what was there didn't have that stretchy pull you want from a good pizza."
Masterful use of olive oil,2025-03-15,5,"The drizzle of high-quality olive oil they add just before serving makes all the difference - adds richness, enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, and adds a wonderful aromatic element. Simple but transformative."
Sloppy presentation,2024-09-15,3,"The pizza looked like it had been assembled in a hurry - toppings haphazardly thrown on, cheese unevenly distributed, and the cutting was so uneven that some slices were twice the size of others. Taste was okay, but appearance matters too."
Phenomenal crust,2023-08-26,5,"Whatever they do to their dough is magical - it's got that perfect combination of crispy and chewy with a slight sourdough tang. I could eat their plain crust by itself, it's that good."
Tiny portion sizes,2023-02-01,2,"Their 'personal' pizza is the size of a CD. For $15, I expected something that would actually satisfy my hunger. Had to order a second one, turning a quick lunch into an expensive disappointment."
Perfect for watching sports,2024-08-22,4,"Great setup with TVs visible from every table, excellent pitcher specials during games, and their 'Game Day' pizza loaded with multiple meats and jalapeños is the perfect sports-watching food. Atmosphere gets lively but not obnoxious."
Perfect for dietary restrictions,2024-04-07,5,"As someone with multiple food allergies, I appreciate that they take dietary concerns seriously. Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"
Cold center burnt edges,2024-02-19,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Crust like cardboard,2025-03-21,2,"The crust had all the flavor and texture of packing material - dry, tough, and completely devoid of character. Even the decent toppings couldn't save it. The foundation of good pizza is good dough, and this wasn't it."
Brilliant seasonal rotation,2025-07-01,5,"Love that they have a rotating seasonal pizza that showcases what's fresh. The current spring offering with asparagus, green garlic, and fresh peas is bright and delicious - a perfect reflection of the season."
Underwhelming and basic,2024-01-11,3,"Nothing particularly wrong with it, but nothing memorable either. Standard crust, standard sauce, standard toppings. In a city with so many pizza options, this place doesn't give you any reason to return."
Too much cheese,2025-07-01,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Perfect buffalo mozzarella application,2023-10-31,5,They understand that buffalo mozzarella shouldn't be cooked too long or it loses its distinctive texture and flavor. Applied in dollops after the pizza is mostly baked so it just barely melts while maintaining its creamy integrity. Technical perfection!
Greasy and disappointing,2024-02-28,2,"I had high hopes based on the reviews, but my pizza was swimming in grease. The crust was undercooked in the center, and the promised 'fresh vegetables' looked and tasted canned. Such a letdown."
Amazing Detroit-style,2023-11-12,5,"Their Detroit-style square pizza is incredible - crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior, and those corner pieces are to die for! The pepperoni cup and char perfectly. Worth the 30-minute wait."
Excellent for takeout,2023-11-18,4,"Their pizza travels remarkably well. Even after a 20-minute drive home, the crust was still crispy and everything was at the perfect temperature. They have their packaging technique down to a science."
Tomato sauce tasted rancid,2024-02-08,1,"The sauce had a distinctly off flavor that suggested the tomatoes had gone bad before processing. After two bites, couldn't continue eating as the rancid notes became more pronounced. Basic food safety seems questionable."
Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2025-06-20,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
Crispy yet chewy perfection,2023-11-18,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."
Burned bottom raw top,2023-05-17,1,The bottom of the crust was completely black while the cheese on top wasn't fully melted. This temperature imbalance suggests serious issues with their oven management and pizza-making technique.
Epic meat lovers option,2025-01-28,4,"If you're a carnivore, their 'Butcher's Block' pizza is incredible. Five different meats, all high quality - the soppressata and house-made sausage are standouts. Just be ready for a food coma afterward!"
Tasteless cheese substitute,2023-07-27,2,"Their vegan cheese option was terrible - had no meltability, a grainy texture, and tasted strongly of coconut which clashed with the tomato sauce. If you can't do vegan cheese well, better to offer cheese-free options that are properly balanced."
Perfect for picky eaters,2024-10-14,4,Their 'build your own quarter' option is genius - a large pizza divided into quadrants with different toppings. Perfect for our family where everyone wants something different. No more ordering multiple pizzas!
Superior ingredients make the difference,2024-04-06,5,"They import their flour from Italy, use San Marzano tomatoes, and make their mozzarella in-house daily. The commitment to quality ingredients is evident in every bite - nothing is an afterthought."
Absurdly small slices,2024-01-28,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."
Not worth the wait,2024-03-18,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."
Excellence in simplicity,2024-10-17,5,"Their classic Margherita showcases their commitment to quality - the balance of sweet-acidic tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella, fragrant basil, and that perfectly chewy-crisp crust. Proof that simple can be sublime."
New owners ruined it,2023-03-11,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."
Perfect balance of flavors,2024-08-09,5,"Their 'Mediterranean' pizza has the perfect balance of flavors - the briny olives, tangy feta, fresh tomatoes, and herb-infused olive oil all complement each other without any one element overwhelming the others."
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2024-08-05,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."
Tomato sauce tasted rancid,2024-04-06,1,"The sauce had a distinctly off flavor that suggested the tomatoes had gone bad before processing. After two bites, couldn't continue eating as the rancid notes became more pronounced. Basic food safety seems questionable."
Perfect for dietary restrictions,2024-01-20,5,"As someone with multiple food allergies, I appreciate that they take dietary concerns seriously. Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"
Not enough cheese,2023-01-07,3,"The sauce and crust were good, but they're stingy with cheese. You could see the sauce through the sparse cheese layer, and what was there didn't have that stretchy pull you want from a good pizza."
Incredible vodka sauce base,2024-06-05,5,"Their vodka sauce pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil is something special. The creamy, slightly spicy sauce is a perfect alternative to traditional tomato sauce. Add prosciutto for an extra flavor dimension!"
Too noisy for conversation,2023-08-12,3,The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option.
Sauce like ketchup,2024-10-18,2,"The sauce was suspiciously sweet and one-dimensional, reminiscent of ketchup rather than a proper pizza sauce. No evidence of herbs, garlic, or any complexity. Ruined what otherwise could have been a decent pizza."
Brilliant use of fermented dough,2024-05-17,5,Their 72-hour fermented dough has incredible depth of flavor with subtle sourdough notes. The extended fermentation creates a complex web of flavors and perfect texture that you simply can't achieve with quick-rise methods.
Sloppy presentation,2023-07-05,3,"The pizza looked like it had been assembled in a hurry - toppings haphazardly thrown on, cheese unevenly distributed, and the cutting was so uneven that some slices were twice the size of others. Taste was okay, but appearance matters too."
Excellent Chicago deep dish,2023-07-12,5,"Hard to find authentic Chicago-style pizza in this area, but they nail it. The buttery, flaky crust, the layering of cheese under the sauce, the chunky tomato topping - all perfect. Worth the 45-minute cook time."
Excellent wine pairings,2025-06-23,5,"Their curated wine list is designed specifically to pair with their pizzas, and the staff is knowledgeable about suggesting the perfect match. The house red with their sausage pizza is a transcendent combination."
Excellent customer service,2024-07-08,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
All style no substance,2024-10-18,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."
Too expensive for pizza,2024-02-11,3,"The pizza is good, I'll give them that. But $30 for a basic large cheese pizza is highway robbery. Add toppings and you're looking at $40-50. The quality doesn't justify these premium prices."
No-cheese option was all sauce,2024-02-20,2,"Ordered a cheese-free pizza for my dairy-allergic friend, but they made no adjustments - just removed the cheese and left a soggy sauce-covered bread. Good pizza without cheese requires rebalancing other elements."
Spicy special was too much,2023-10-29,2,Their 'Firebreather' pizza should come with a warning label. It wasn't enjoyably spicy - it was painfully hot to the point where I couldn't taste anything else. Had to throw most of it away.
Toppings slide right off,2024-08-16,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Perfect for large parties,2025-03-29,5,"Their party package is fantastic - multiple 18-inch pizzas with varied toppings, plenty of sides, and they were accommodating with our group of 20. Everything arrived hot and on time, and they included all the necessary paper goods."
Perfect ingredient distribution,2024-10-12,5,"Every bite had the perfect combination of ingredients - no barren spots, no overwhelming clumps. The toppings were distributed with such precision it almost seemed measured. The mark of true professionals!"
Cold center burnt edges,2023-12-04,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Authentic coal-fired perfection,2024-03-24,5,Their coal-fired oven gives the pizza a distinctive char and smoky flavor that's impossible to replicate any other way. The slight bitterness of the charred spots perfectly balances the sweetness of the sauce.
Creative seasonal specials,2024-04-03,5,"Just had their spring special with asparagus, lemon ricotta, and prosciutto. The combination was bright, fresh, and perfect for the season. Love that they use local, seasonal ingredients."
Amazing Detroit-style,2023-05-23,5,"Their Detroit-style square pizza is incredible - crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior, and those corner pieces are to die for! The pepperoni cup and char perfectly. Worth the 30-minute wait."
Creative seasonal specials,2023-04-06,5,"Just had their spring special with asparagus, lemon ricotta, and prosciutto. The combination was bright, fresh, and perfect for the season. Love that they use local, seasonal ingredients."
Perfect pepperoni placement,2024-07-24,5,"As a pepperoni perfectionist, I appreciate that they space the pepperoni so every bite gets one full piece. No bare spots or clumped areas. Shows attention to detail that elevates the whole experience."
False advertising on size,2024-11-13,2,"Their menu clearly states that a large pizza is 16 inches, but what we received couldn't have been more than 14 inches. When questioned, they claimed their menu was outdated but refused any adjustment."
Spicy special was too much,2023-07-10,2,Their 'Firebreather' pizza should come with a warning label. It wasn't enjoyably spicy - it was painfully hot to the point where I couldn't taste anything else. Had to throw most of it away.
Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2023-06-19,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
Inconsistent quality,2024-05-23,3,I've been here three times. First visit: amazing. Second: terrible. Third: just okay. Seems like it really depends on who's working that day. Wish they could maintain better quality control.
Refrigerated dough taste,2024-06-16,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."
Rude staff ruined the meal,2024-04-21,2,"The pizza itself was decent, but the counter staff was incredibly rude - sighing when I asked questions about ingredients, rushing my order, and actually rolling their eyes when I requested extra napkins."
Way too much oregano,2025-05-11,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
Too much emphasis on appearance,2023-04-05,3,"The pizza was clearly designed to look good in photos - perfect symmetry, vibrant colors, photogenic cheese pull - but the flavor was underwhelming. Style over substance for the Instagram crowd."
Epic meat lovers option,2023-02-19,4,"If you're a carnivore, their 'Butcher's Block' pizza is incredible. Five different meats, all high quality - the soppressata and house-made sausage are standouts. Just be ready for a food coma afterward!"

Greasy and disappointing,2023-03-18,2,"I had high hopes based on the reviews, but my pizza was swimming in grease. The crust was undercooked in the center, and the promised 'fresh vegetables' looked and tasted canned. Such a letdown."
Perfect temperature every time,2024-11-26,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
Late night savior,2024-01-28,4,"Open until 2am on weekends, this place has saved me many times after a night out. Their slices are huge, reheated perfectly crisp, and they have creative toppings that hit the spot when you're hungry late at night."
Supreme quality control,2024-03-25,5,"Visited multiple times and the consistency is impressive - every pizza comes out identical to the last one, with the same excellent quality. Shows serious commitment to training and standards that's rare in casual dining."

Epic meat lovers option,2023-01-20,4,"If you're a carnivore, their 'Butcher's Block' pizza is incredible. Five different meats, all high quality - the soppressata and house-made sausage are standouts. Just be ready for a food coma afterward!"

Outstanding breakfast pizza,2024-03-25,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
Greasy and disappointing,2023-02-06,2,"I had high hopes based on the reviews, but my pizza was swimming in grease. The crust was undercooked in the center, and the promised 'fresh vegetables' looked and tasted canned. Such a letdown."
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2024-09-29,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2023-07-25,5,They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!
Perfect temperature every time,2025-01-01,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."

Perfect thin crust,2023-06-08,5,"If you're a thin crust fan, this is your place. Cracker-thin, crispy all the way through, yet somehow still has a nice chew. Their simple cheese pizza showcases their excellent sauce - slightly sweet with a nice herb blend."
Crispy yet chewy perfection,2025-04-17,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."
Family night favorite,2023-04-04,5,"We bring our kids here every Friday night. The staff always make them feel special, providing dough for them to play with while we wait. Their kid-sized pizzas are perfect, and the parents love the craft beer selection."
Refrigerated dough taste,2023-08-21,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2023-07-08,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Authentic coal-fired perfection,2024-12-01,5,Their coal-fired oven gives the pizza a distinctive char and smoky flavor that's impossible to replicate any other way. The slight bitterness of the charred spots perfectly balances the sweetness of the sauce.
Excellent Chicago deep dish,2023-08-17,5,"Hard to find authentic Chicago-style pizza in this area, but they nail it. The buttery, flaky crust, the layering of cheese under the sauce, the chunky tomato topping - all perfect. Worth the 45-minute cook time."
Best Hawaiian in the city,2023-05-09,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."
Authentic Italian experience,2023-04-08,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
False advertising on ingredients,2024-03-30,1,"Menu promised 'house-made Italian sausage' but what came on my pizza was clearly pre-formed, uniform pellets of commercial sausage. When questioned, staff admitted they don't make any ingredients in-house despite menu claims."
Tomato sauce tasted rancid,2025-06-12,1,"The sauce had a distinctly off flavor that suggested the tomatoes had gone bad before processing. After two bites, couldn't continue eating as the rancid notes became more pronounced. Basic food safety seems questionable."
Inconsistent quality,2023-08-11,3,I've been here three times. First visit: amazing. Second: terrible. Third: just okay. Seems like it really depends on who's working that day. Wish they could maintain better quality control.
Perfect for big groups,2024-06-19,5,"We had a party of 12 and they accommodated us perfectly. Their 20-inch shareable pizzas are great for groups, and they were happy to do half-and-half toppings to please everyone. Service was impressively coordinated."
Too much sauce,2023-04-06,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Perfect ingredient distribution,2024-06-07,5,"Every bite had the perfect combination of ingredients - no barren spots, no overwhelming clumps. The toppings were distributed with such precision it almost seemed measured. The mark of true professionals!"
Not enough cheese,2025-02-10,3,"The sauce and crust were good, but they're stingy with cheese. You could see the sauce through the sparse cheese layer, and what was there didn't have that stretchy pull you want from a good pizza."
Inconsistent quality,2023-11-12,3,I've been here three times. First visit: amazing. Second: terrible. Third: just okay. Seems like it really depends on who's working that day. Wish they could maintain better quality control.
Too greasy to enjoy,2023-12-19,2,"Had to literally blot my pizza with napkins, which came away completely saturated with grease. Whatever flavor might have been there was drowned in oil. Couldn't finish it as it was making me feel ill."
Perfect pepperoni placement,2024-06-30,5,"As a pepperoni perfectionist, I appreciate that they space the pepperoni so every bite gets one full piece. No bare spots or clumped areas. Shows attention to detail that elevates the whole experience."
Crispy yet chewy perfection,2024-07-30,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2025-03-04,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
False advertising on size,2024-10-07,2,"Their menu clearly states that a large pizza is 16 inches, but what we received couldn't have been more than 14 inches. When questioned, they claimed their menu was outdated but refused any adjustment."
Inconsistent quality,2023-03-27,3,I've been here three times. First visit: amazing. Second: terrible. Third: just okay. Seems like it really depends on who's working that day. Wish they could maintain better quality control.
Best Hawaiian in the city,2024-03-28,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."

Crispy yet chewy perfection,2023-07-02,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."
Authentic Italian experience,2023-06-18,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
Burned bottom raw top,2023-10-10,1,The bottom of the crust was completely black while the cheese on top wasn't fully melted. This temperature imbalance suggests serious issues with their oven management and pizza-making technique.
Outstanding wood-fired perfection,2025-03-05,5,The wood-fired oven gives their pizza a distinctive smoky complexity you can't get any other way. The slight char adds bitterness that balances the sweetness of the sauce perfectly. Worth seeking out for this unique flavor profile.
Terrible delivery experience,2024-12-30,1,"Ordered for Valentine's Day and regretted it. Pizza took 2 hours to arrive, was cold, and had the wrong toppings. Called the restaurant and they seemed completely unconcerned. Never again."
Hidden gem for vegans,2023-08-11,5,"I can't believe how good their vegan pizza is! They make their own cashew cheese that actually melts properly, and their vegetable toppings are always fresh and seasonal. Even my non-vegan friends love it."
Too much cornmeal,2023-05-28,3,"They use cornmeal on the bottom of the crust to prevent sticking, which is standard, but they use so much that it's like eating pizza on a sandpaper surface. Gritty texture overwhelms the experience."
Perfect pepperoni placement,2024-07-22,5,"As a pepperoni perfectionist, I appreciate that they space the pepperoni so every bite gets one full piece. No bare spots or clumped areas. Shows attention to detail that elevates the whole experience."
Best pizza in town,2023-12-28,5,"The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Their signature pepperoni pizza had the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, and the pepperoni curled up into little cups of deliciousness. Will definitely be back!"
Best white pizza ever,2025-05-02,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"
Underwhelming and basic,2024-05-25,3,"Nothing particularly wrong with it, but nothing memorable either. Standard crust, standard sauce, standard toppings. In a city with so many pizza options, this place doesn't give you any reason to return."
Too noisy for conversation,2025-04-22,3,The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option.
Too much sauce,2023-01-19,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Too much garlic,2024-04-21,3,"I love garlic but this was excessive - felt like they mistook cloves for teaspoons in the recipe. My breath was lethal afterward, and the powerful flavor overwhelmed the other ingredients."
Perfect for dietary restrictions,2024-10-31,5,"As someone with multiple food allergies, I appreciate that they take dietary concerns seriously. Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"
Excellent for takeout,2024-11-24,4,"Their pizza travels remarkably well. Even after a 20-minute drive home, the crust was still crispy and everything was at the perfect temperature. They have their packaging technique down to a science."
Perfect for lunch specials,2023-09-22,4,"Their lunch deal is unbeatable - $10 for a 10-inch pizza and small salad. The pizza comes out quickly, is always fresh, and the perfect size for one person. Great place for a work lunch."
Too thin to be satisfying,2025-01-25,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Excessive grease pooling,2024-12-11,2,"Had to continuously blot the pizza with napkins as pools of orange grease formed on top of the cheese with every passing minute. By the end, the napkins were completely saturated and transparent. Felt unhealthy even by pizza standards."
Toppings slide right off,2024-05-27,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2025-05-21,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Authentic coal-fired perfection,2024-11-09,5,Their coal-fired oven gives the pizza a distinctive char and smoky flavor that's impossible to replicate any other way. The slight bitterness of the charred spots perfectly balances the sweetness of the sauce.
Supreme quality control,2023-08-13,5,"Visited multiple times and the consistency is impressive - every pizza comes out identical to the last one, with the same excellent quality. Shows serious commitment to training and standards that's rare in casual dining."
Excellent wine pairings,2023-12-18,5,"Their curated wine list is designed specifically to pair with their pizzas, and the staff is knowledgeable about suggesting the perfect match. The house red with their sausage pizza is a transcendent combination."
Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2023-05-18,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies. The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."
Excellence in simplicity,2025-02-22,5,"Their classic Margherita showcases their commitment to quality - the balance of sweet-acidic tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella, fragrant basil, and that perfectly chewy-crisp crust. Proof that simple can be sublime."
Cold center burnt edges,2024-12-21,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2024-01-18,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Doughy and undercooked,2024-09-14,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Outstanding breakfast pizza,2024-08-10,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
Greasy and disappointing,2023-10-09,2,"I had high hopes based on the reviews, but my pizza was swimming in grease. The crust was undercooked in the center, and the promised 'fresh vegetables' looked and tasted canned. Such a letdown."
Cold center burnt edges,2023-11-30,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Too much salt in the dough,2023-09-18,2,The crust was so salty it was almost inedible - overwhelmed all the other flavors and left me incredibly thirsty afterward. A heavy hand with salt ruined what could have been a good pizza.
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2023-02-20,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Perfect temperature every time,2023-03-01,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
Rude staff ruined the meal,2023-02-23,2,"The pizza itself was decent, but the counter staff was incredibly rude - sighing when I asked questions about ingredients, rushing my order, and actually rolling their eyes when I requested extra napkins."
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2024-07-12,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
Perfect for large parties,2023-11-26,5,"Their party package is fantastic - multiple 18-inch pizzas with varied toppings, plenty of sides, and they were accommodating with our group of 20. Everything arrived hot and on time, and they included all the necessary paper goods."
Spicy special was too much,2024-01-17,2,Their 'Firebreather' pizza should come with a warning label. It wasn't enjoyably spicy - it was painfully hot to the point where I couldn't taste anything else. Had to throw most of it away.
Excessive grease pooling,2024-07-10,2,"Had to continuously blot the pizza with napkins as pools of orange grease formed on top of the cheese with every passing minute. By the end, the napkins were completely saturated and transparent. Felt unhealthy even by pizza standards."
New owners ruined it,2023-08-06,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."
Epic meat lovers option,2025-01-20,4,"If you're a carnivore, their 'Butcher's Block' pizza is incredible. Five different meats, all high quality - the soppressata and house-made sausage are standouts. Just be ready for a food coma afterward!"
Cold center burnt edges,2023-12-02,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Innovative toppings,2024-10-23,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."
Too much cornmeal,2024-06-07,3,"They use cornmeal on the bottom of the crust to prevent sticking, which is standard, but they use so much that it's like eating pizza on a sandpaper surface. Gritty texture overwhelms the experience."
Innovative flavor combinations,2023-09-26,5,"Their 'Avant Garde' menu section features combinations I would never have thought of but somehow work perfectly. The pear, gorgonzola, walnut, and honey pizza was a revelation of sweet, salty, and savory harmony."
Exceptional spinach ricotta pie,2024-07-20,5,Their white pizza with spinach and ricotta is exceptional - the creamy richness of the cheese balanced by the slight bitterness of the greens. The garlic-infused olive oil base ties everything together perfectly.
Unmelted cheese in the center,2024-03-11,2,"The edges were fine but the center had cold, unmelted cheese - a sign the oven wasn't hot enough or the pizza wasn't cooked long enough. Basic pizza fundamentals seem to be lacking."
Outstanding variety of options,2024-02-07,5,"Their menu has something for everyone - traditional options done well, creative specialties, and customizable choices. Even have dessert pizzas that are surprisingly good (try the Nutella and banana!)."
Perfect ingredient distribution,2025-01-12,5,"Every bite had the perfect combination of ingredients - no barren spots, no overwhelming clumps. The toppings were distributed with such precision it almost seemed measured. The mark of true professionals!"
No-cheese option was all sauce,2025-04-30,2,"Ordered a cheese-free pizza for my dairy-allergic friend, but they made no adjustments - just removed the cheese and left a soggy sauce-covered bread. Good pizza without cheese requires rebalancing other elements."
No flavor distinction,2023-11-09,3,Ordered two completely different specialty pizzas but they somehow tasted nearly identical. It's like they use the same base for everything and the toppings don't impart enough distinctive character.
All style no substance,2025-01-30,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."
Excellent Chicago deep dish,2025-06-04,5,"Hard to find authentic Chicago-style pizza in this area, but they nail it. The buttery, flaky crust, the layering of cheese under the sauce, the chunky tomato topping - all perfect. Worth the 45-minute cook time."
Excellent customer service,2023-02-18,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
Way too much crust,2023-05-27,2,The edge crust (cornicione) was comically large - almost half of each slice was just bread with no toppings. This ratio of crust to actual pizza was way off and made for a disappointing experience.
Best pizza in town,2024-01-22,5,"The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Their signature pepperoni pizza had the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, and the pepperoni curled up into little cups of deliciousness. Will definitely be back!"
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2023-11-22,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2024-08-26,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Mediocre at best,2023-04-13,3,"Nothing terrible but nothing special either. The crust was okay, toppings were standard, and service was fine. It's the kind of place you go when you're in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip for."
Ideal char-to-chew ratio,2023-09-19,5,The small charred bubbles on the crust add amazing flavor without dominating. They've mastered that balance between the slight bitterness of char and the natural sweetness of the dough. Technical perfection!
Bland sauce needs work,2024-03-16,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
Way too much oregano,2025-05-12,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
Tough leathery crust,2023-06-30,2,"The crust was so tough I almost couldn't bite through it - like trying to eat leather. The edges were particularly problematic, had to tear pieces off with significant effort. Completely lacks the pleasant chewiness good pizza should have."
No-cheese option was all sauce,2024-11-16,2,"Ordered a cheese-free pizza for my dairy-allergic friend, but they made no adjustments - just removed the cheese and left a soggy sauce-covered bread. Good pizza without cheese requires rebalancing other elements."
Cold center burnt edges,2025-05-24,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Weird aftertaste,2023-05-31,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."
Too much garlic,2025-02-27,3,"I love garlic but this was excessive - felt like they mistook cloves for teaspoons in the recipe. My breath was lethal afterward, and the powerful flavor overwhelmed the other ingredients."
Family night favorite,2023-10-19,5,"We bring our kids here every Friday night. The staff always make them feel special, providing dough for them to play with while we wait. Their kid-sized pizzas are perfect, and the parents love the craft beer selection."
Lackluster veggie options,2024-10-02,3,"Their vegetable toppings lacked freshness and flavor - the mushrooms were clearly canned, the peppers were soft and faded, and the onions were sparse. Disappointing for a place that advertises farm-fresh ingredients."
Excellent attention to cooking time,2025-05-26,5,They nail the cooking time perfectly - pulling the pizza from the oven at exactly the right moment when the cheese is fully melted and bubbling but not yet browned. Shows expertise and attention to detail.
Ideal char-to-chew ratio,2024-04-07,5,The small charred bubbles on the crust add amazing flavor without dominating. They've mastered that balance between the slight bitterness of char and the natural sweetness of the dough. Technical perfection!
Crust like cardboard,2024-10-28,2,"The crust had all the flavor and texture of packing material - dry, tough, and completely devoid of character. Even the decent toppings couldn't save it. The foundation of good pizza is good dough, and this wasn't it."
Too much cheese,2025-03-02,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Masterful use of olive oil,2023-10-20,5,"The drizzle of high-quality olive oil they add just before serving makes all the difference - adds richness, enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, and adds a wonderful aromatic element. Simple but transformative."
Expert-level pizza folding,2023-03-26,5,Their thin-crust slices fold perfectly New York-style without cracking or losing toppings. The slight resistance before the fold is exactly what you want - showing the perfect balance of crisp and chew.
Pizza barely survived the drive home,2023-06-28,2,"Ordered takeout and by the time I got home (15 minutes), the pizza was a soggy mess. They clearly don't use appropriate packaging for takeout - no vents to release steam means the crust steams itself into sogginess."
Tough leathery crust,2023-04-06,2,"The crust was so tough I almost couldn't bite through it - like trying to eat leather. The edges were particularly problematic, had to tear pieces off with significant effort. Completely lacks the pleasant chewiness good pizza should have."
Too much emphasis on appearance,2023-02-11,3,"The pizza was clearly designed to look good in photos - perfect symmetry, vibrant colors, photogenic cheese pull - but the flavor was underwhelming. Style over substance for the Instagram crowd."
Too much sauce,2023-03-27,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Greasy and disappointing,2025-04-29,2,"I had high hopes based on the reviews, but my pizza was swimming in grease. The crust was undercooked in the center, and the promised 'fresh vegetables' looked and tasted canned. Such a letdown."
Tomato sauce tasted rancid,2025-06-05,1,"The sauce had a distinctly off flavor that suggested the tomatoes had gone bad before processing. After two bites, couldn't continue eating as the rancid notes became more pronounced. Basic food safety seems questionable."
Too thin to be satisfying,2024-06-26,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Superior ingredients make the difference,2024-04-08,5,"They import their flour from Italy, use San Marzano tomatoes, and make their mozzarella in-house daily. The commitment to quality ingredients is evident in every bite - nothing is an afterthought."
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2024-04-10,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."
Great gluten-free option,2023-10-26,4,"As someone with celiac disease, finding good gluten-free pizza is a challenge. Their cauliflower crust was one of the best I've had - doesn't fall apart and has a nice flavor. Toppings were generous too."
Stale-tasting crust,2023-09-20,2,"The crust had a stale, almost cardboard-like quality that suggests either old dough or old flour. Fresh ingredients on top couldn't compensate for the foundation being off."
Sloppy presentation,2025-05-06,3,"The pizza looked like it had been assembled in a hurry - toppings haphazardly thrown on, cheese unevenly distributed, and the cutting was so uneven that some slices were twice the size of others. Taste was okay, but appearance matters too."
Best white pizza ever,2023-11-30,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"
Perfect for dietary restrictions,2023-10-11,5,"As someone with multiple food allergies, I appreciate that they take dietary concerns seriously. Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"
Spicy special was too much,2023-11-03,2,Their 'Firebreather' pizza should come with a warning label. It wasn't enjoyably spicy - it was painfully hot to the point where I couldn't taste anything else. Had to throw most of it away.
Too noisy for conversation,2024-04-25,3,The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option.
Exceptional spinach ricotta pie,2023-08-04,5,Their white pizza with spinach and ricotta is exceptional - the creamy richness of the cheese balanced by the slight bitterness of the greens. The garlic-infused olive oil base ties everything together perfectly.
Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2023-07-02,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies. The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."
Way too much oregano,2023-10-20,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
Best white pizza ever,2023-09-20,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"
Refrigerated dough taste,2023-12-08,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."
Late night savior,2024-12-27,4,"Open until 2am on weekends, this place has saved me many times after a night out. Their slices are huge, reheated perfectly crisp, and they have creative toppings that hit the spot when you're hungry late at night."
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2023-04-10,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."
Burned bottom raw top,2023-10-28,1,The bottom of the crust was completely black while the cheese on top wasn't fully melted. This temperature imbalance suggests serious issues with their oven management and pizza-making technique.
Magnificent flavor layering,2024-02-18,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Excellent customer service,2023-06-20,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
Pizza arrived upside-down,2023-07-09,1,Delivery driver must have taken a sharp turn because our pizza arrived completely flipped over in the box - all toppings stuck to the lid. Restaurant offered no solution other than suggesting we 'scrape it off and reassemble it.'
Exceptional spinach ricotta pie,2023-04-13,5,Their white pizza with spinach and ricotta is exceptional - the creamy richness of the cheese balanced by the slight bitterness of the greens. The garlic-infused olive oil base ties everything together perfectly.
Excellent beer pairing suggestions,2024-08-10,5,"Not only is their pizza excellent (try the fig and prosciutto!), but the staff is knowledgeable about their craft beer selection and can suggest the perfect pairing for whatever pizza you order."
False advertising on size,2023-09-01,2,"Their menu clearly states that a large pizza is 16 inches, but what we received couldn't have been more than 14 inches. When questioned, they claimed their menu was outdated but refused any adjustment."
Overpriced for what you get,2024-08-05,3,"$24 for a medium pizza with just two toppings seems excessive. The ingredients were fresh and the crust was good, but nothing justified the premium price. There are better values elsewhere in town."
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2024-04-25,5,They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!
Cold center burnt edges,2024-10-05,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Masterclass in proper baking,2024-09-27,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
Perfect for big groups,2025-02-20,5,"We had a party of 12 and they accommodated us perfectly. Their 20-inch shareable pizzas are great for groups, and they were happy to do half-and-half toppings to please everyone. Service was impressively coordinated."
Family night favorite,2023-05-05,5,"We bring our kids here every Friday night. The staff always make them feel special, providing dough for them to play with while we wait. Their kid-sized pizzas are perfect, and the parents love the craft beer selection."
Supreme quality control,2025-01-31,5,"Visited multiple times and the consistency is impressive - every pizza comes out identical to the last one, with the same excellent quality. Shows serious commitment to training and standards that's rare in casual dining."
Cold center burnt edges,2025-05-26,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Stale-tasting crust,2023-11-26,2,"The crust had a stale, almost cardboard-like quality that suggests either old dough or old flour. Fresh ingredients on top couldn't compensate for the foundation being off."
Sauce like ketchup,2023-12-17,2,"The sauce was suspiciously sweet and one-dimensional, reminiscent of ketchup rather than a proper pizza sauce. No evidence of herbs, garlic, or any complexity. Ruined what otherwise could have been a decent pizza."
Excellent customer service,2024-11-22,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2023-07-12,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2023-11-15,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2023-08-10,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."
Dirty restaurant,2024-02-26,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."
Excellent customer service,2023-06-15,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
All style no substance,2024-01-05,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."
Innovative flavor combinations,2023-04-08,5,"Their 'Avant Garde' menu section features combinations I would never have thought of but somehow work perfectly. The pear, gorgonzola, walnut, and honey pizza was a revelation of sweet, salty, and savory harmony."
Brilliant seasonal rotation,2023-05-24,5,"Love that they have a rotating seasonal pizza that showcases what's fresh. The current spring offering with asparagus, green garlic, and fresh peas is bright and delicious - a perfect reflection of the season."
Great gluten-free option,2025-01-03,4,"As someone with celiac disease, finding good gluten-free pizza is a challenge. Their cauliflower crust was one of the best I've had - doesn't fall apart and has a nice flavor. Toppings were generous too."
Excellent customer service,2024-11-09,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
Innovative toppings,2025-02-08,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."
Late night savior,2024-11-19,4,"Open until 2am on weekends, this place has saved me many times after a night out. Their slices are huge, reheated perfectly crisp, and they have creative toppings that hit the spot when you're hungry late at night."
Excellence in simplicity,2025-05-14,5,"Their classic Margherita showcases their commitment to quality - the balance of sweet-acidic tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella, fragrant basil, and that perfectly chewy-crisp crust. Proof that simple can be sublime."
Too thin to be satisfying,2023-05-25,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Cheese solidified too quickly,2023-06-18,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Brilliant use of fermented dough,2024-04-18,5,Their 72-hour fermented dough has incredible depth of flavor with subtle sourdough notes. The extended fermentation creates a complex web of flavors and perfect texture that you simply can't achieve with quick-rise methods.
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2024-10-08,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."
Pizza arrived upside-down,2025-03-16,1,Delivery driver must have taken a sharp turn because our pizza arrived completely flipped over in the box - all toppings stuck to the lid. Restaurant offered no solution other than suggesting we 'scrape it off and reassemble it.'
Innovative toppings,2024-10-02,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."

Exceptional spinach ricotta pie,2024-10-05,5,Their white pizza with spinach and ricotta is exceptional - the creamy richness of the cheese balanced by the slight bitterness of the greens. The garlic-infused olive oil base ties everything together perfectly.
Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2025-02-24,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
Skimpy on toppings,2024-02-22,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."
Best Hawaiian in the city,2024-05-05,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2024-03-02,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."
Tough leathery crust,2024-07-06,2,"The crust was so tough I almost couldn't bite through it - like trying to eat leather. The edges were particularly problematic, had to tear pieces off with significant effort. Completely lacks the pleasant chewiness good pizza should have."
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2024-10-30,5,They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!
Tiny portion sizes,2024-02-03,2,"Their 'personal' pizza is the size of a CD. For $15, I expected something that would actually satisfy my hunger. Had to order a second one, turning a quick lunch into an expensive disappointment."
Great gluten-free option,2023-12-24,4,"As someone with celiac disease, finding good gluten-free pizza is a challenge. Their cauliflower crust was one of the best I've had - doesn't fall apart and has a nice flavor. Toppings were generous too."
Family night favorite,2024-03-17,5,"We bring our kids here every Friday night. The staff always make them feel special, providing dough for them to play with while we wait. Their kid-sized pizzas are perfect, and the parents love the craft beer selection."
Bland sauce needs work,2023-08-03,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
Perfect ingredient distribution,2024-08-09,5,"Every bite had the perfect combination of ingredients - no barren spots, no overwhelming clumps. The toppings were distributed with such precision it almost seemed measured. The mark of true professionals!"
Perfect crunch factor,2024-04-27,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."
Outstanding breakfast pizza,2024-07-17,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
Absurdly small slices,2023-02-10,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."
Pizza arrived upside-down,2025-04-25,1,Delivery driver must have taken a sharp turn because our pizza arrived completely flipped over in the box - all toppings stuck to the lid. Restaurant offered no solution other than suggesting we 'scrape it off and reassemble it.'
Perfect for dietary restrictions,2023-12-17,5,"As someone with multiple food allergies, I appreciate that they take dietary concerns seriously. Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"
Not enough cheese,2024-06-28,3,"The sauce and crust were good, but they're stingy with cheese. You could see the sauce through the sparse cheese layer, and what was there didn't have that stretchy pull you want from a good pizza."
Stale-tasting crust,2023-08-06,2,"The crust had a stale, almost cardboard-like quality that suggests either old dough or old flour. Fresh ingredients on top couldn't compensate for the foundation being off."
Excessive grease pooling,2023-06-12,2,"Had to continuously blot the pizza with napkins as pools of orange grease formed on top of the cheese with every passing minute. By the end, the napkins were completely saturated and transparent. Felt unhealthy even by pizza standards."
No flavor distinction,2023-02-24,3,Ordered two completely different specialty pizzas but they somehow tasted nearly identical. It's like they use the same base for everything and the toppings don't impart enough distinctive character.
Not worth the wait,2025-01-01,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."
Best white pizza ever,2023-08-26,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"

Brilliant use of fermented dough,2023-08-06,5,Their 72-hour fermented dough has incredible depth of flavor with subtle sourdough notes. The extended fermentation creates a complex web of flavors and perfect texture that you simply can't achieve with quick-rise methods.
Superior ingredients make the difference,2023-04-15,5,"They import their flour from Italy, use San Marzano tomatoes, and make their mozzarella in-house daily. The commitment to quality ingredients is evident in every bite - nothing is an afterthought."
Too salty,2025-02-27,2,"Everything I tried was oversalted - the crust, the sauce, and especially the cheese. It was like they were trying to ensure you'd order more drinks. Couldn't finish my pizza and was thirsty all night."
Perfect crust-to-topping ratio,2025-03-11,5,"Some places overload toppings so the crust gets soggy, others are too sparse. This place gets it perfect - enough toppings to get some in every bite, but not so much that the structural integrity is compromised."
Underwhelming and basic,2024-05-04,3,"Nothing particularly wrong with it, but nothing memorable either. Standard crust, standard sauce, standard toppings. In a city with so many pizza options, this place doesn't give you any reason to return."
Sauce like ketchup,2024-08-21,2,"The sauce was suspiciously sweet and one-dimensional, reminiscent of ketchup rather than a proper pizza sauce. No evidence of herbs, garlic, or any complexity. Ruined what otherwise could have been a decent pizza."
Outstanding breakfast pizza,2023-04-19,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
Phenomenal crust,2024-02-22,5,"Whatever they do to their dough is magical - it's got that perfect combination of crispy and chewy with a slight sourdough tang. I could eat their plain crust by itself, it's that good."
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2023-08-22,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."
Phenomenal crust,2024-12-09,5,"Whatever they do to their dough is magical - it's got that perfect combination of crispy and chewy with a slight sourdough tang. I could eat their plain crust by itself, it's that good."
Best pizza in town,2023-03-16,5,"The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Their signature pepperoni pizza had the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, and the pepperoni curled up into little cups of deliciousness. Will definitely be back!"
Burned bottom raw top,2023-07-16,1,The bottom of the crust was completely black while the cheese on top wasn't fully melted. This temperature imbalance suggests serious issues with their oven management and pizza-making technique.
Excellence in simplicity,2024-07-24,5,"Their classic Margherita showcases their commitment to quality - the balance of sweet-acidic tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella, fragrant basil, and that perfectly chewy-crisp crust. Proof that simple can be sublime."
Way too much oregano,2025-01-27,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
Perfect for watching sports,2025-04-08,4,"Great setup with TVs visible from every table, excellent pitcher specials during games, and their 'Game Day' pizza loaded with multiple meats and jalapeños is the perfect sports-watching food. Atmosphere gets lively but not obnoxious."
Brilliant use of fermented dough,2024-01-12,5,Their 72-hour fermented dough has incredible depth of flavor with subtle sourdough notes. The extended fermentation creates a complex web of flavors and perfect texture that you simply can't achieve with quick-rise methods.
Skimpy on toppings,2024-07-25,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."
Perfect for late-night cravings,2024-09-05,5,"Open until 3am on weekends, this place has saved many late nights. The slices are huge, they reheat them perfectly so they're crispy, and their special late-night menu items are creative and delicious."
Way too much crust,2023-11-04,2,The edge crust (cornicione) was comically large - almost half of each slice was just bread with no toppings. This ratio of crust to actual pizza was way off and made for a disappointing experience.
Too much cornmeal,2025-03-30,3,"They use cornmeal on the bottom of the crust to prevent sticking, which is standard, but they use so much that it's like eating pizza on a sandpaper surface. Gritty texture overwhelms the experience."
Perfect for lunch specials,2023-08-25,4,"Their lunch deal is unbeatable - $10 for a 10-inch pizza and small salad. The pizza comes out quickly, is always fresh, and the perfect size for one person. Great place for a work lunch."
Excessive grease pooling,2023-11-21,2,"Had to continuously blot the pizza with napkins as pools of orange grease formed on top of the cheese with every passing minute. By the end, the napkins were completely saturated and transparent. Felt unhealthy even by pizza standards."
Not enough cheese,2023-03-03,3,"The sauce and crust were good, but they're stingy with cheese. You could see the sauce through the sparse cheese layer, and what was there didn't have that stretchy pull you want from a good pizza."
Sloppy presentation,2024-06-02,3,"The pizza looked like it had been assembled in a hurry - toppings haphazardly thrown on, cheese unevenly distributed, and the cutting was so uneven that some slices were twice the size of others. Taste was okay, but appearance matters too."
Perfect for dietary restrictions,2023-01-08,5,"As someone with multiple food allergies, I appreciate that they take dietary concerns seriously. Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"
Great gluten-free option,2023-11-16,4,"As someone with celiac disease, finding good gluten-free pizza is a challenge. Their cauliflower crust was one of the best I've had - doesn't fall apart and has a nice flavor. Toppings were generous too."
Exceptional sauce-making technique,2023-11-21,5,"You can tell their sauce is made with properly hand-crushed tomatoes - it has that perfect texture with small chunks rather than being completely smooth. The bright flavor suggests minimal cooking, allowing the tomato quality to shine."
Burned bottom raw top,2024-11-03,1,The bottom of the crust was completely black while the cheese on top wasn't fully melted. This temperature imbalance suggests serious issues with their oven management and pizza-making technique.
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2025-06-04,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Greasy and disappointing,2023-08-01,2,"I had high hopes based on the reviews, but my pizza was swimming in grease. The crust was undercooked in the center, and the promised 'fresh vegetables' looked and tasted canned. Such a letdown."
Perfect for big groups,2023-11-05,5,"We had a party of 12 and they accommodated us perfectly. Their 20-inch shareable pizzas are great for groups, and they were happy to do half-and-half toppings to please everyone. Service was impressively coordinated."
Creative seasonal specials,2023-06-27,5,"Just had their spring special with asparagus, lemon ricotta, and prosciutto. The combination was bright, fresh, and perfect for the season. Love that they use local, seasonal ingredients."
Way too much crust,2023-07-31,2,The edge crust (cornicione) was comically large - almost half of each slice was just bread with no toppings. This ratio of crust to actual pizza was way off and made for a disappointing experience.
Perfect temperature every time,2024-07-08,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
Tomato sauce tasted rancid,2024-11-23,1,"The sauce had a distinctly off flavor that suggested the tomatoes had gone bad before processing. After two bites, couldn't continue eating as the rancid notes became more pronounced. Basic food safety seems questionable."
Excellent beer pairing suggestions,2023-07-22,5,"Not only is their pizza excellent (try the fig and prosciutto!), but the staff is knowledgeable about their craft beer selection and can suggest the perfect pairing for whatever pizza you order."
Doughy and undercooked,2025-03-30,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Lackluster veggie options,2025-06-28,3,"Their vegetable toppings lacked freshness and flavor - the mushrooms were clearly canned, the peppers were soft and faded, and the onions were sparse. Disappointing for a place that advertises farm-fresh ingredients."
Tough leathery crust,2023-07-09,2,"The crust was so tough I almost couldn't bite through it - like trying to eat leather. The edges were particularly problematic, had to tear pieces off with significant effort. Completely lacks the pleasant chewiness good pizza should have."
Mediocre at best,2023-03-16,3,"Nothing terrible but nothing special either. The crust was okay, toppings were standard, and service was fine. It's the kind of place you go when you're in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip for."
Unmelted cheese in the center,2023-04-02,2,"The edges were fine but the center had cold, unmelted cheese - a sign the oven wasn't hot enough or the pizza wasn't cooked long enough. Basic pizza fundamentals seem to be lacking."
Outstanding breakfast pizza,2024-08-25,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
Perfect for dietary restrictions,2024-03-03,5,"As someone with multiple food allergies, I appreciate that they take dietary concerns seriously. Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"
No-cheese option was all sauce,2024-04-21,2,"Ordered a cheese-free pizza for my dairy-allergic friend, but they made no adjustments - just removed the cheese and left a soggy sauce-covered bread. Good pizza without cheese requires rebalancing other elements."
Incredible vodka sauce base,2023-01-14,5,"Their vodka sauce pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil is something special. The creamy, slightly spicy sauce is a perfect alternative to traditional tomato sauce. Add prosciutto for an extra flavor dimension!"
Innovative flavor combinations,2025-05-02,5,"Their 'Avant Garde' menu section features combinations I would never have thought of but somehow work perfectly. The pear, gorgonzola, walnut, and honey pizza was a revelation of sweet, salty, and savory harmony."
Perfect thin crust,2024-03-31,5,"If you're a thin crust fan, this is your place. Cracker-thin, crispy all the way through, yet somehow still has a nice chew. Their simple cheese pizza showcases their excellent sauce - slightly sweet with a nice herb blend."
Absurdly small slices,2023-10-29,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."
Supreme quality control,2025-04-21,5,"Visited multiple times and the consistency is impressive - every pizza comes out identical to the last one, with the same excellent quality. Shows serious commitment to training and standards that's rare in casual dining."
Hidden gem for vegans,2023-06-03,5,"I can't believe how good their vegan pizza is! They make their own cashew cheese that actually melts properly, and their vegetable toppings are always fresh and seasonal. Even my non-vegan friends love it."
Perfect crunch factor,2024-02-29,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."
Perfect NY-style slices,2023-09-02,5,"As a transplant from NYC, I've been searching for authentic NY-style pizza. This place nails it - thin, foldable slices with the right amount of chew and grease. Their plain cheese slice is perfection."
Too much salt in the dough,2024-08-30,2,The crust was so salty it was almost inedible - overwhelmed all the other flavors and left me incredibly thirsty afterward. A heavy hand with salt ruined what could have been a good pizza.
Excellent wine pairings,2023-06-09,5,"Their curated wine list is designed specifically to pair with their pizzas, and the staff is knowledgeable about suggesting the perfect match. The house red with their sausage pizza is a transcendent combination."
Brilliant use of fermented dough,2024-01-12,5,Their 72-hour fermented dough has incredible depth of flavor with subtle sourdough notes. The extended fermentation creates a complex web of flavors and perfect texture that you simply can't achieve with quick-rise methods.
Too much emphasis on appearance,2024-04-27,3,"The pizza was clearly designed to look good in photos - perfect symmetry, vibrant colors, photogenic cheese pull - but the flavor was underwhelming. Style over substance for the Instagram crowd."
Masterclass in proper baking,2024-10-04,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
Late night savior,2025-04-25,4,"Open until 2am on weekends, this place has saved me many times after a night out. Their slices are huge, reheated perfectly crisp, and they have creative toppings that hit the spot when you're hungry late at night."
Too salty,2024-03-26,2,"Everything I tried was oversalted - the crust, the sauce, and especially the cheese. It was like they were trying to ensure you'd order more drinks. Couldn't finish my pizza and was thirsty all night."
No-cheese option was all sauce,2023-03-26,2,"Ordered a cheese-free pizza for my dairy-allergic friend, but they made no adjustments - just removed the cheese and left a soggy sauce-covered bread. Good pizza without cheese requires rebalancing other elements."
Epic meat lovers option,2025-02-19,4,"If you're a carnivore, their 'Butcher's Block' pizza is incredible. Five different meats, all high quality - the soppressata and house-made sausage are standouts. Just be ready for a food coma afterward!"
Tasteless cheese substitute,2023-05-24,2,"Their vegan cheese option was terrible - had no meltability, a grainy texture, and tasted strongly of coconut which clashed with the tomato sauce. If you can't do vegan cheese well, better to offer cheese-free options that are properly balanced."
False advertising on ingredients,2024-09-28,1,"Menu promised 'house-made Italian sausage' but what came on my pizza was clearly pre-formed, uniform pellets of commercial sausage. When questioned, staff admitted they don't make any ingredients in-house despite menu claims."
Best Hawaiian in the city,2024-05-26,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."
Bland sauce needs work,2023-01-17,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
All style no substance,2025-05-01,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."
Best white pizza ever,2024-08-24,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2023-03-10,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
Sloppy presentation,2025-04-05,3,"The pizza looked like it had been assembled in a hurry - toppings haphazardly thrown on, cheese unevenly distributed, and the cutting was so uneven that some slices were twice the size of others. Taste was okay, but appearance matters too."
Burned mouth on first bite,2024-02-03,2,"They served the pizza dangerously hot - barely out of the oven with no time to cool. Severely burned the roof of my mouth on the first bite, which ruined the rest of the meal and my next few days."
Perfect for large parties,2023-11-30,5,"Their party package is fantastic - multiple 18-inch pizzas with varied toppings, plenty of sides, and they were accommodating with our group of 20. Everything arrived hot and on time, and they included all the necessary paper goods."
Doughy and undercooked,2025-05-06,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Excellent wine pairings,2023-08-10,5,"Their curated wine list is designed specifically to pair with their pizzas, and the staff is knowledgeable about suggesting the perfect match. The house red with their sausage pizza is a transcendent combination."
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2023-07-22,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."
Too much garlic,2024-11-06,3,"I love garlic but this was excessive - felt like they mistook cloves for teaspoons in the recipe. My breath was lethal afterward, and the powerful flavor overwhelmed the other ingredients."
Perfect for kids' parties,2023-10-05,5,"Hosted my son's birthday here and it was fantastic. They did a dough-tossing demonstration for the kids, let them make their own mini pizzas, and the staff was incredibly patient and kind."
Brilliant use of fermented dough,2024-06-08,5,Their 72-hour fermented dough has incredible depth of flavor with subtle sourdough notes. The extended fermentation creates a complex web of flavors and perfect texture that you simply can't achieve with quick-rise methods.
Toppings slide right off,2024-08-19,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Exceptional spinach ricotta pie,2023-07-21,5,Their white pizza with spinach and ricotta is exceptional - the creamy richness of the cheese balanced by the slight bitterness of the greens. The garlic-infused olive oil base ties everything together perfectly.
Too thin to be satisfying,2024-04-09,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Way too much crust,2023-01-10,2,The edge crust (cornicione) was comically large - almost half of each slice was just bread with no toppings. This ratio of crust to actual pizza was way off and made for a disappointing experience.
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2023-02-15,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."
Ideal char-to-chew ratio,2023-08-28,5,The small charred bubbles on the crust add amazing flavor without dominating. They've mastered that balance between the slight bitterness of char and the natural sweetness of the dough. Technical perfection!
Perfect for kids' parties,2023-07-08,5,"Hosted my son's birthday here and it was fantastic. They did a dough-tossing demonstration for the kids, let them make their own mini pizzas, and the staff was incredibly patient and kind."
Inconsistent quality,2024-11-04,3,I've been here three times. First visit: amazing. Second: terrible. Third: just okay. Seems like it really depends on who's working that day. Wish they could maintain better quality control.
Excellent Chicago deep dish,2024-06-27,5,"Hard to find authentic Chicago-style pizza in this area, but they nail it. The buttery, flaky crust, the layering of cheese under the sauce, the chunky tomato topping - all perfect. Worth the 45-minute cook time."
Not enough cheese,2025-03-26,3,"The sauce and crust were good, but they're stingy with cheese. You could see the sauce through the sparse cheese layer, and what was there didn't have that stretchy pull you want from a good pizza."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2025-03-09,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Lackluster veggie options,2023-09-26,3,"Their vegetable toppings lacked freshness and flavor - the mushrooms were clearly canned, the peppers were soft and faded, and the onions were sparse. Disappointing for a place that advertises farm-fresh ingredients."
Undercooked in the middle,2023-03-02,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."
Refrigerated dough taste,2025-05-17,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."
Perfect thin crust,2024-07-23,5,"If you're a thin crust fan, this is your place. Cracker-thin, crispy all the way through, yet somehow still has a nice chew. Their simple cheese pizza showcases their excellent sauce - slightly sweet with a nice herb blend."
Best Hawaiian in the city,2023-02-14,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."
Perfect for picky eaters,2023-09-28,4,Their 'build your own quarter' option is genius - a large pizza divided into quadrants with different toppings. Perfect for our family where everyone wants something different. No more ordering multiple pizzas!
Masterful use of olive oil,2024-09-16,5,"The drizzle of high-quality olive oil they add just before serving makes all the difference - adds richness, enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, and adds a wonderful aromatic element. Simple but transformative."
Perfect for large parties,2023-07-25,5,"Their party package is fantastic - multiple 18-inch pizzas with varied toppings, plenty of sides, and they were accommodating with our group of 20. Everything arrived hot and on time, and they included all the necessary paper goods."
Weird aftertaste,2025-03-02,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."
Brilliant seasonal rotation,2024-11-05,5,"Love that they have a rotating seasonal pizza that showcases what's fresh. The current spring offering with asparagus, green garlic, and fresh peas is bright and delicious - a perfect reflection of the season."
Perfect thin crust,2023-07-27,5,"If you're a thin crust fan, this is your place. Cracker-thin, crispy all the way through, yet somehow still has a nice chew. Their simple cheese pizza showcases their excellent sauce - slightly sweet with a nice herb blend."
Too much salt in the dough,2023-04-04,2,The crust was so salty it was almost inedible - overwhelmed all the other flavors and left me incredibly thirsty afterward. A heavy hand with salt ruined what could have been a good pizza.
Burned bottom raw top,2024-07-29,1,The bottom of the crust was completely black while the cheese on top wasn't fully melted. This temperature imbalance suggests serious issues with their oven management and pizza-making technique.
Phenomenal crust,2024-04-28,5,"Whatever they do to their dough is magical - it's got that perfect combination of crispy and chewy with a slight sourdough tang. I could eat their plain crust by itself, it's that good."
Cheese solidified too quickly,2024-06-13,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Perfect for late-night cravings,2025-04-27,5,"Open until 3am on weekends, this place has saved many late nights. The slices are huge, they reheat them perfectly so they're crispy, and their special late-night menu items are creative and delicious."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2024-12-14,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Perfect buffalo mozzarella application,2023-01-23,5,They understand that buffalo mozzarella shouldn't be cooked too long or it loses its distinctive texture and flavor. Applied in dollops after the pizza is mostly baked so it just barely melts while maintaining its creamy integrity. Technical perfection!
Perfect for watching sports,2023-08-14,4,"Great setup with TVs visible from every table, excellent pitcher specials during games, and their 'Game Day' pizza loaded with multiple meats and jalapeños is the perfect sports-watching food. Atmosphere gets lively but not obnoxious."
Excellent Chicago deep dish,2023-07-17,5,"Hard to find authentic Chicago-style pizza in this area, but they nail it. The buttery, flaky crust, the layering of cheese under the sauce, the chunky tomato topping - all perfect. Worth the 45-minute cook time."
Too much cornmeal,2024-11-03,3,"They use cornmeal on the bottom of the crust to prevent sticking, which is standard, but they use so much that it's like eating pizza on a sandpaper surface. Gritty texture overwhelms the experience."
Superior ingredients make the difference,2023-06-02,5,"They import their flour from Italy, use San Marzano tomatoes, and make their mozzarella in-house daily. The commitment to quality ingredients is evident in every bite - nothing is an afterthought."
Disappointed with service,2024-10-03,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."
Lackluster veggie options,2024-02-13,3,"Their vegetable toppings lacked freshness and flavor - the mushrooms were clearly canned, the peppers were soft and faded, and the onions were sparse. Disappointing for a place that advertises farm-fresh ingredients."
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2025-02-02,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
Late night savior,2023-08-05,4,"Open until 2am on weekends, this place has saved me many times after a night out. Their slices are huge, reheated perfectly crisp, and they have creative toppings that hit the spot when you're hungry late at night."
Superior ingredients make the difference,2024-02-17,5,"They import their flour from Italy, use San Marzano tomatoes, and make their mozzarella in-house daily. The commitment to quality ingredients is evident in every bite - nothing is an afterthought."
Outstanding wood-fired perfection,2023-07-24,5,The wood-fired oven gives their pizza a distinctive smoky complexity you can't get any other way. The slight char adds bitterness that balances the sweetness of the sauce perfectly. Worth seeking out for this unique flavor profile.
Excellent customer service,2024-10-31,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
Skimpy on toppings,2025-01-26,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."
Perfect pepperoni placement,2023-05-24,5,"As a pepperoni perfectionist, I appreciate that they space the pepperoni so every bite gets one full piece. No bare spots or clumped areas. Shows attention to detail that elevates the whole experience."
Phenomenal crust,2024-05-16,5,"Whatever they do to their dough is magical - it's got that perfect combination of crispy and chewy with a slight sourdough tang. I could eat their plain crust by itself, it's that good."
Excellent customer service,2023-05-19,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
All style no substance,2023-06-22,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."
Outstanding breakfast pizza,2023-10-15,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
Burnt crust ruins it,2024-01-03,2,"They claim 'char' is part of the Neapolitan experience, but there's a difference between char and burnt. The entire bottom of my pizza was black and bitter. Scraping it off meant losing half the crust."
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2024-07-25,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
Disappointed with service,2024-10-11,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."
Supreme quality control,2025-01-19,5,"Visited multiple times and the consistency is impressive - every pizza comes out identical to the last one, with the same excellent quality. Shows serious commitment to training and standards that's rare in casual dining."
Overpriced for what you get,2024-07-15,3,"$24 for a medium pizza with just two toppings seems excessive. The ingredients were fresh and the crust was good, but nothing justified the premium price. There are better values elsewhere in town."
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2025-03-13,5,They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!
Perfect for lunch specials,2024-03-16,4,"Their lunch deal is unbeatable - $10 for a 10-inch pizza and small salad. The pizza comes out quickly, is always fresh, and the perfect size for one person. Great place for a work lunch."
Brilliant use of fermented dough,2023-03-14,5,Their 72-hour fermented dough has incredible depth of flavor with subtle sourdough notes. The extended fermentation creates a complex web of flavors and perfect texture that you simply can't achieve with quick-rise methods.
Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2023-07-11,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies. The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."
False advertising on ingredients,2023-01-01,1,"Menu promised 'house-made Italian sausage' but what came on my pizza was clearly pre-formed, uniform pellets of commercial sausage. When questioned, staff admitted they don't make any ingredients in-house despite menu claims."
All style no substance,2023-05-09,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."
Bland sauce needs work,2024-09-11,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
Righteous ranch drizzle,2024-05-23,5,Their house-made ranch drizzle takes their pizzas to another level. It's not your typical ranch - has hints of dill and garlic with a perfect consistency that adds creaminess without making things soggy.
Perfect for watching sports,2023-05-11,4,"Great setup with TVs visible from every table, excellent pitcher specials during games, and their 'Game Day' pizza loaded with multiple meats and jalapeños is the perfect sports-watching food. Atmosphere gets lively but not obnoxious."
Spicy special was too much,2024-12-10,2,Their 'Firebreather' pizza should come with a warning label. It wasn't enjoyably spicy - it was painfully hot to the point where I couldn't taste anything else. Had to throw most of it away.
Painfully obvious cheap ingredients,2023-10-12,2,"The pre-shredded cheese didn't melt properly, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the sausage had that distinctive processed flavor. At these prices, cutting corners on ingredients is inexcusable."
Dirty restaurant,2025-02-23,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."

New owners ruined it,2023-11-12,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."
Perfect for big groups,2024-01-02,5,"We had a party of 12 and they accommodated us perfectly. Their 20-inch shareable pizzas are great for groups, and they were happy to do half-and-half toppings to please everyone. Service was impressively coordinated."
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2025-01-17,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."
Family night favorite,2024-09-24,5,"We bring our kids here every Friday night. The staff always make them feel special, providing dough for them to play with while we wait. Their kid-sized pizzas are perfect, and the parents love the craft beer selection."
Sauce like ketchup,2024-01-14,2,"The sauce was suspiciously sweet and one-dimensional, reminiscent of ketchup rather than a proper pizza sauce. No evidence of herbs, garlic, or any complexity. Ruined what otherwise could have been a decent pizza."
Excellent beer pairing suggestions,2025-05-08,5,"Not only is their pizza excellent (try the fig and prosciutto!), but the staff is knowledgeable about their craft beer selection and can suggest the perfect pairing for whatever pizza you order."
Excellent for takeout,2024-12-24,4,"Their pizza travels remarkably well. Even after a 20-minute drive home, the crust was still crispy and everything was at the perfect temperature. They have their packaging technique down to a science."
Supreme quality control,2024-11-14,5,"Visited multiple times and the consistency is impressive - every pizza comes out identical to the last one, with the same excellent quality. Shows serious commitment to training and standards that's rare in casual dining."
Dirty restaurant,2023-01-09,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."
Expert-level pizza folding,2025-02-15,5,Their thin-crust slices fold perfectly New York-style without cracking or losing toppings. The slight resistance before the fold is exactly what you want - showing the perfect balance of crisp and chew.
Stale-tasting crust,2024-09-15,2,"The crust had a stale, almost cardboard-like quality that suggests either old dough or old flour. Fresh ingredients on top couldn't compensate for the foundation being off."
Excellence in simplicity,2023-09-23,5,"Their classic Margherita showcases their commitment to quality - the balance of sweet-acidic tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella, fragrant basil, and that perfectly chewy-crisp crust. Proof that simple can be sublime."
Too much sauce,2024-07-04,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Magnificent flavor layering,2023-07-31,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Incredible vodka sauce base,2023-01-27,5,"Their vodka sauce pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil is something special. The creamy, slightly spicy sauce is a perfect alternative to traditional tomato sauce. Add prosciutto for an extra flavor dimension!"
Absurdly small slices,2025-01-02,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."
Overpriced for what you get,2024-06-08,3,"$24 for a medium pizza with just two toppings seems excessive. The ingredients were fresh and the crust was good, but nothing justified the premium price. There are better values elsewhere in town."
Tasteless cheese substitute,2024-01-15,2,"Their vegan cheese option was terrible - had no meltability, a grainy texture, and tasted strongly of coconut which clashed with the tomato sauce. If you can't do vegan cheese well, better to offer cheese-free options that are properly balanced."
Perfect balance of flavors,2024-02-16,5,"Their 'Mediterranean' pizza has the perfect balance of flavors - the briny olives, tangy feta, fresh tomatoes, and herb-infused olive oil all complement each other without any one element overwhelming the others."

The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."
Too thin to be satisfying,2024-06-09,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Exceptional spinach ricotta pie,2024-09-25,5,Their white pizza with spinach and ricotta is exceptional - the creamy richness of the cheese balanced by the slight bitterness of the greens. The garlic-infused olive oil base ties everything together perfectly.
Innovative flavor combinations,2024-10-17,5,"Their 'Avant Garde' menu section features combinations I would never have thought of but somehow work perfectly. The pear, gorgonzola, walnut, and honey pizza was a revelation of sweet, salty, and savory harmony."
Perfect thin crust,2024-07-01,5,"If you're a thin crust fan, this is your place. Cracker-thin, crispy all the way through, yet somehow still has a nice chew. Their simple cheese pizza showcases their excellent sauce - slightly sweet with a nice herb blend."
Perfect textural contrast,2023-10-26,5,"The contrast between the crisp bottom, the tender interior crumb, the gooey cheese, and the slight resistance of the toppings creates a textural symphony. Each bite is interesting and satisfying in a different way."
Perfect crunch factor,2024-02-24,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."
Outstanding variety of options,2024-05-08,5,"Their menu has something for everyone - traditional options done well, creative specialties, and customizable choices. Even have dessert pizzas that are surprisingly good (try the Nutella and banana!)."

Rude staff ruined the meal,2023-08-21,2,"The pizza itself was decent, but the counter staff was incredibly rude - sighing when I asked questions about ingredients, rushing my order, and actually rolling their eyes when I requested extra napkins."
Perfect for large parties,2025-06-16,5,"Their party package is fantastic - multiple 18-inch pizzas with varied toppings, plenty of sides, and they were accommodating with our group of 20. Everything arrived hot and on time, and they included all the necessary paper goods."
Toppings slide right off,2023-02-21,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.

Too salty,2025-06-03,2,"Everything I tried was oversalted - the crust, the sauce, and especially the cheese. It was like they were trying to ensure you'd order more drinks. Couldn't finish my pizza and was thirsty all night."
Perfect buffalo mozzarella application,2024-02-12,5,They understand that buffalo mozzarella shouldn't be cooked too long or it loses its distinctive texture and flavor. Applied in dollops after the pizza is mostly baked so it just barely melts while maintaining its creamy integrity. Technical perfection!
Greasy and disappointing,2024-09-28,2,"I had high hopes based on the reviews, but my pizza was swimming in grease. The crust was undercooked in the center, and the promised 'fresh vegetables' looked and tasted canned. Such a letdown."
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2023-10-14,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
Cheese solidified too quickly,2025-06-28,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Skimpy on toppings,2023-08-21,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."

Not enough cheese,2024-12-07,3,"The sauce and crust were good, but they're stingy with cheese. You could see the sauce through the sparse cheese layer, and what was there didn't have that stretchy pull you want from a good pizza."

Excellent Chicago deep dish,2023-01-16,5,"Hard to find authentic Chicago-style pizza in this area, but they nail it. The buttery, flaky crust, the layering of cheese under the sauce, the chunky tomato topping - all perfect. Worth the 45-minute cook time."
New owners ruined it,2023-08-13,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."

Outstanding wood-fired perfection,2024-11-18,5,The wood-fired oven gives their pizza a distinctive smoky complexity you can't get any other way. The slight char adds bitterness that balances the sweetness of the sauce perfectly. Worth seeking out for this unique flavor profile.
Crispy yet chewy perfection,2024-05-12,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."
Too much cheese,2023-12-14,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Best white pizza ever,2024-06-19,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"
Expert-level pizza folding,2024-11-18,5,Their thin-crust slices fold perfectly New York-style without cracking or losing toppings. The slight resistance before the fold is exactly what you want - showing the perfect balance of crisp and chew.
Perfect pepperoni placement,2025-04-15,5,"As a pepperoni perfectionist, I appreciate that they space the pepperoni so every bite gets one full piece. No bare spots or clumped areas. Shows attention to detail that elevates the whole experience."
Great gluten-free option,2025-03-04,4,"As someone with celiac disease, finding good gluten-free pizza is a challenge. Their cauliflower crust was one of the best I've had - doesn't fall apart and has a nice flavor. Toppings were generous too."
Too much sauce,2024-08-10,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2024-10-24,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
All style no substance,2024-08-15,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."
Skimpy on toppings,2025-04-29,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."
Disappointed with service,2023-04-22,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."
Not enough cheese,2024-09-16,3,"The sauce and crust were good, but they're stingy with cheese. You could see the sauce through the sparse cheese layer, and what was there didn't have that stretchy pull you want from a good pizza."
Lackluster veggie options,2025-02-08,3,"Their vegetable toppings lacked freshness and flavor - the mushrooms were clearly canned, the peppers were soft and faded, and the onions were sparse. Disappointing for a place that advertises farm-fresh ingredients."
Perfect for dietary restrictions,2025-03-26,5,"As someone with multiple food allergies, I appreciate that they take dietary concerns seriously. Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"
Late night savior,2025-03-16,4,"Open until 2am on weekends, this place has saved me many times after a night out. Their slices are huge, reheated perfectly crisp, and they have creative toppings that hit the spot when you're hungry late at night."
Phenomenal crust,2024-01-18,5,"Whatever they do to their dough is magical - it's got that perfect combination of crispy and chewy with a slight sourdough tang. I could eat their plain crust by itself, it's that good."
Too noisy for conversation,2023-10-21,3,The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option.
Perfect crunch factor,2024-04-18,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."
Way too much oregano,2025-04-25,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
Tiny portion sizes,2024-02-22,2,"Their 'personal' pizza is the size of a CD. For $15, I expected something that would actually satisfy my hunger. Had to order a second one, turning a quick lunch into an expensive disappointment."
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2023-12-03,5,They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!
Perfect thin crust,2024-01-20,5,"If you're a thin crust fan, this is your place. Cracker-thin, crispy all the way through, yet somehow still has a nice chew. Their simple cheese pizza showcases their excellent sauce - slightly sweet with a nice herb blend."
Excessive grease pooling,2024-04-01,2,"Had to continuously blot the pizza with napkins as pools of orange grease formed on top of the cheese with every passing minute. By the end, the napkins were completely saturated and transparent. Felt unhealthy even by pizza standards."
Perfect crunch factor,2023-08-03,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."

Refrigerated dough taste,2024-04-12,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."
Excellent wine pairings,2024-08-14,5,"Their curated wine list is designed specifically to pair with their pizzas, and the staff is knowledgeable about suggesting the perfect match. The house red with their sausage pizza is a transcendent combination."

Perfect buffalo mozzarella application,2024-10-14,5,They understand that buffalo mozzarella shouldn't be cooked too long or it loses its distinctive texture and flavor. Applied in dollops after the pizza is mostly baked so it just barely melts while maintaining its creamy integrity. Technical perfection!
Too much garlic,2025-03-23,3,"I love garlic but this was excessive - felt like they mistook cloves for teaspoons in the recipe. My breath was lethal afterward, and the powerful flavor overwhelmed the other ingredients."
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2025-03-19,5,They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!
Weird aftertaste,2023-10-11,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."
Cold center burnt edges,2023-05-23,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
No-cheese option was all sauce,2024-08-09,2,"Ordered a cheese-free pizza for my dairy-allergic friend, but they made no adjustments - just removed the cheese and left a soggy sauce-covered bread. Good pizza without cheese requires rebalancing other elements."
Perfect for picky eaters,2025-05-11,4,Their 'build your own quarter' option is genius - a large pizza divided into quadrants with different toppings. Perfect for our family where everyone wants something different. No more ordering multiple pizzas!
Best white pizza ever,2025-06-05,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"

Greasy and disappointing,2024-11-30,2,"I had high hopes based on the reviews, but my pizza was swimming in grease. The crust was undercooked in the center, and the promised 'fresh vegetables' looked and tasted canned. Such a letdown."
Best pizza in town,2025-03-07,5,"The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Their signature pepperoni pizza had the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, and the pepperoni curled up into little cups of deliciousness. Will definitely be back!"
Toppings slide right off,2023-03-28,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Cheese solidified too quickly,2023-07-22,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Authentic Italian experience,2024-11-13,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
Creative seasonal specials,2024-07-31,5,"Just had their spring special with asparagus, lemon ricotta, and prosciutto. The combination was bright, fresh, and perfect for the season. Love that they use local, seasonal ingredients."
Innovative toppings,2024-10-29,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."

Not worth the wait,2025-01-03,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."
Underwhelming and basic,2024-08-14,3,"Nothing particularly wrong with it, but nothing memorable either. Standard crust, standard sauce, standard toppings. In a city with so many pizza options, this place doesn't give you any reason to return."
Dirty restaurant,2024-07-09,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."
Excellent attention to cooking time,2024-11-19,5,They nail the cooking time perfectly - pulling the pizza from the oven at exactly the right moment when the cheese is fully melted and bubbling but not yet browned. Shows expertise and attention to detail.
Perfect textural contrast,2024-02-11,5,"The contrast between the crisp bottom, the tender interior crumb, the gooey cheese, and the slight resistance of the toppings creates a textural symphony. Each bite is interesting and satisfying in a different way."

Superior ingredients make the difference,2025-02-11,5,"They import their flour from Italy, use San Marzano tomatoes, and make their mozzarella in-house daily. The commitment to quality ingredients is evident in every bite - nothing is an afterthought."
Best Hawaiian in the city,2025-02-21,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."
Epic meat lovers option,2025-05-11,4,"If you're a carnivore, their 'Butcher's Block' pizza is incredible. Five different meats, all high quality - the soppressata and house-made sausage are standouts. Just be ready for a food coma afterward!"
Excellence in simplicity,2025-06-15,5,"Their classic Margherita showcases their commitment to quality - the balance of sweet-acidic tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella, fragrant basil, and that perfectly chewy-crisp crust. Proof that simple can be sublime."

Too greasy to enjoy,2024-02-06,2,"Had to literally blot my pizza with napkins, which came away completely saturated with grease. Whatever flavor might have been there was drowned in oil. Couldn't finish it as it was making me feel ill."
Unmelted cheese in the center,2025-03-27,2,"The edges were fine but the center had cold, unmelted cheese - a sign the oven wasn't hot enough or the pizza wasn't cooked long enough. Basic pizza fundamentals seem to be lacking."
Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2024-05-17,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies.

Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2023-10-21,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."

Outstanding variety of options,2023-01-04,5,"Their menu has something for everyone - traditional options done well, creative specialties, and customizable choices. Even have dessert pizzas that are surprisingly good (try the Nutella and banana!)."
Best white pizza ever,2024-01-17,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"
Perfect crunch factor,2024-05-12,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."
Perfect for dietary restrictions,2024-06-26,5,"As someone with multiple food allergies, I appreciate that they take dietary concerns seriously. Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"
Innovative toppings,2023-07-20,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."
Too much salt in the dough,2023-03-11,2,The crust was so salty it was almost inedible - overwhelmed all the other flavors and left me incredibly thirsty afterward. A heavy hand with salt ruined what could have been a good pizza.
Perfect for watching sports,2023-09-18,4,"Great setup with TVs visible from every table, excellent pitcher specials during games, and their 'Game Day' pizza loaded with multiple meats and jalapeños is the perfect sports-watching food. Atmosphere gets lively but not obnoxious."
Too much cheese,2024-10-26,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Too much emphasis on appearance,2025-04-21,3,"The pizza was clearly designed to look good in photos - perfect symmetry, vibrant colors, photogenic cheese pull - but the flavor was underwhelming. Style over substance for the Instagram crowd."
Way too much oregano,2023-03-23,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
Way too much crust,2023-05-06,2,The edge crust (cornicione) was comically large - almost half of each slice was just bread with no toppings. This ratio of crust to actual pizza was way off and made for a disappointing experience.
Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2023-09-04,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
Painfully obvious cheap ingredients,2024-04-22,2,"The pre-shredded cheese didn't melt properly, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the sausage had that distinctive processed flavor. At these prices, cutting corners on ingredients is inexcusable."
Masterclass in proper baking,2023-12-03,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
Amazing Detroit-style,2023-02-11,5,"Their Detroit-style square pizza is incredible - crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior, and those corner pieces are to die for! The pepperoni cup and char perfectly. Worth the 30-minute wait."

Greasy and disappointing,2024-07-28,2,"I had high hopes based on the reviews, but my pizza was swimming in grease. The crust was undercooked in the center, and the promised 'fresh vegetables' looked and tasted canned. Such a letdown."
Excellent Chicago deep dish,2023-11-18,5,"Hard to find authentic Chicago-style pizza in this area, but they nail it. The buttery, flaky crust, the layering of cheese under the sauce, the chunky tomato topping - all perfect. Worth the 45-minute cook time."
Amazing Detroit-style,2024-11-26,5,"Their Detroit-style square pizza is incredible - crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior, and those corner pieces are to die for! The pepperoni cup and char perfectly. Worth the 30-minute wait."
Burnt crust ruins it,2024-03-14,2,"They claim 'char' is part of the Neapolitan experience, but there's a difference between char and burnt. The entire bottom of my pizza was black and bitter. Scraping it off meant losing half the crust."
Perfect for lunch specials,2023-04-18,4,"Their lunch deal is unbeatable - $10 for a 10-inch pizza and small salad. The pizza comes out quickly, is always fresh, and the perfect size for one person. Great place for a work lunch."
Spicy special was too much,2024-07-31,2,Their 'Firebreather' pizza should come with a warning label. It wasn't enjoyably spicy - it was painfully hot to the point where I couldn't taste anything else. Had to throw most of it away.
Too noisy for conversation,2023-08-06,3,The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option.
Too expensive for pizza,2024-03-12,3,"The pizza is good, I'll give them that. But $30 for a basic large cheese pizza is highway robbery. Add toppings and you're looking at $40-50. The quality doesn't justify these premium prices."
Too greasy to enjoy,2025-02-07,2,"Had to literally blot my pizza with napkins, which came away completely saturated with grease. Whatever flavor might have been there was drowned in oil. Couldn't finish it as it was making me feel ill."

Mediocre at best,2023-04-25,3,"Nothing terrible but nothing special either. The crust was okay, toppings were standard, and service was fine. It's the kind of place you go when you're in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip for."
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2023-08-21,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
Innovative flavor combinations,2023-11-14,5,"Their 'Avant Garde' menu section features combinations I would never have thought of but somehow work perfectly. The pear, gorgonzola, walnut, and honey pizza was a revelation of sweet, salty, and savory harmony."

Ideal char-to-chew ratio,2023-07-24,5,The small charred bubbles on the crust add amazing flavor without dominating. They've mastered that balance between the slight bitterness of char and the natural sweetness of the dough. Technical perfection!
Too thin to be satisfying,2025-03-18,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Excellent customer service,2024-01-26,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2023-08-16,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Burned bottom raw top,2024-07-26,1,The bottom of the crust was completely black while the cheese on top wasn't fully melted. This temperature imbalance suggests serious issues with their oven management and pizza-making technique.
Outstanding wood-fired perfection,2023-12-03,5,The wood-fired oven gives their pizza a distinctive smoky complexity you can't get any other way. The slight char adds bitterness that balances the sweetness of the sauce perfectly. Worth seeking out for this unique flavor profile.
Perfect crunch factor,2024-03-07,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."
Undercooked in the middle,2024-10-04,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."

Excellent Chicago deep dish,2023-07-11,5,"Hard to find authentic Chicago-style pizza in this area, but they nail it. The buttery, flaky crust, the layering of cheese under the sauce, the chunky tomato topping - all perfect. Worth the 45-minute cook time."
Superior ingredients make the difference,2024-01-18,5,"They import their flour from Italy, use San Marzano tomatoes, and make their mozzarella in-house daily. The commitment to quality ingredients is evident in every bite - nothing is an afterthought."
Dirty restaurant,2024-07-26,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."
Perfect for kids' parties,2024-08-27,5,"Hosted my son's birthday here and it was fantastic. They did a dough-tossing demonstration for the kids, let them make their own mini pizzas, and the staff was incredibly patient and kind."
Too much cheese,2024-11-14,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."

Burned mouth on first bite,2024-10-12,2,"They served the pizza dangerously hot - barely out of the oven with no time to cool. Severely burned the roof of my mouth on the first bite, which ruined the rest of the meal and my next few days."

Pizza arrived upside-down,2025-06-21,1,Delivery driver must have taken a sharp turn because our pizza arrived completely flipped over in the box - all toppings stuck to the lid. Restaurant offered no solution other than suggesting we 'scrape it off and reassemble it.'
Weird aftertaste,2024-12-29,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."
Too noisy for conversation,2025-02-02,3,The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option.
Tiny portion sizes,2023-02-14,2,"Their 'personal' pizza is the size of a CD. For $15, I expected something that would actually satisfy my hunger. Had to order a second one, turning a quick lunch into an expensive disappointment."
Burned mouth on first bite,2025-01-21,2,"They served the pizza dangerously hot - barely out of the oven with no time to cool. Severely burned the roof of my mouth on the first bite, which ruined the rest of the meal and my next few days."

Suspiciously uniform toppings,2023-04-28,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."

Perfect crust-to-topping ratio,2024-10-30,5,"Some places overload toppings so the crust gets soggy, others are too sparse. This place gets it perfect - enough toppings to get some in every bite, but not so much that the structural integrity is compromised."

Skimpy on toppings,2024-06-26,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2025-03-20,5,They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!

Terrible delivery experience,2023-03-17,1,"Ordered for Valentine's Day and regretted it. Pizza took 2 hours to arrive, was cold, and had the wrong toppings. Called the restaurant and they seemed completely unconcerned. Never again."
Too much cornmeal,2024-06-03,3,"They use cornmeal on the bottom of the crust to prevent sticking, which is standard, but they use so much that it's like eating pizza on a sandpaper surface. Gritty texture overwhelms the experience."
Not enough cheese,2025-01-10,3,"The sauce and crust were good, but they're stingy with cheese. You could see the sauce through the sparse cheese layer, and what was there didn't have that stretchy pull you want from a good pizza."

Excessive grease pooling,2024-07-05,2,"Had to continuously blot the pizza with napkins as pools of orange grease formed on top of the cheese with every passing minute. By the end, the napkins were completely saturated and transparent. Felt unhealthy even by pizza standards."

Exceptional spinach ricotta pie,2024-06-29,5,Their white pizza with spinach and ricotta is exceptional - the creamy richness of the cheese balanced by the slight bitterness of the greens. The garlic-infused olive oil base ties everything together perfectly.
Crispy yet chewy perfection,2023-09-01,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."

Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2025-06-27,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.

Bland sauce needs work,2023-05-26,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
Overpriced for what you get,2024-10-09,3,"$24 for a medium pizza with just two toppings seems excessive. The ingredients were fresh and the crust was good, but nothing justified the premium price. There are better values elsewhere in town."

Great gluten-free option,2023-04-03,4,"As someone with celiac disease, finding good gluten-free pizza is a challenge. Their cauliflower crust was one of the best I've had - doesn't fall apart and has a nice flavor. Toppings were generous too."
Innovative flavor combinations,2023-05-23,5,"Their 'Avant Garde' menu section features combinations I would never have thought of but somehow work perfectly. The pear, gorgonzola, walnut, and honey pizza was a revelation of sweet, salty, and savory harmony."
Hidden gem for vegans,2025-03-10,5,"I can't believe how good their vegan pizza is! They make their own cashew cheese that actually melts properly, and their vegetable toppings are always fresh and seasonal. Even my non-vegan friends love it."
Pizza barely survived the drive home,2024-08-25,2,"Ordered takeout and by the time I got home (15 minutes), the pizza was a soggy mess. They clearly don't use appropriate packaging for takeout - no vents to release steam means the crust steams itself into sogginess."
Too much sauce,2024-01-07,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Masterclass in proper baking,2024-09-26,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
Superior ingredients make the difference,2024-05-01,5,"They import their flour from Italy, use San Marzano tomatoes, and make their mozzarella in-house daily. The commitment to quality ingredients is evident in every bite - nothing is an afterthought."
Innovative toppings,2023-10-31,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2024-01-12,5,They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!
All style no substance,2023-06-06,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."
Perfect crust-to-topping ratio,2023-02-03,5,"Some places overload toppings so the crust gets soggy, others are too sparse. This place gets it perfect - enough toppings to get some in every bite, but not so much that the structural integrity is compromised."
Creative seasonal specials,2024-03-19,5,"Just had their spring special with asparagus, lemon ricotta, and prosciutto. The combination was bright, fresh, and perfect for the season. Love that they use local, seasonal ingredients."
Best Hawaiian in the city,2024-11-07,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."
Superior ingredients make the difference,2023-01-19,5,"They import their flour from Italy, use San Marzano tomatoes, and make their mozzarella in-house daily. The commitment to quality ingredients is evident in every bite - nothing is an afterthought."
Best white pizza ever,2025-06-13,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"
Perfect temperature every time,2024-11-22,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
Excellent customer service,2023-11-19,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
Too much sauce,2024-05-30,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Excellent wine pairings,2025-05-10,5,"Their curated wine list is designed specifically to pair with their pizzas, and the staff is knowledgeable about suggesting the perfect match. The house red with their sausage pizza is a transcendent combination."
Cold center burnt edges,2024-08-15,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Authentic coal-fired perfection,2025-03-23,5,Their coal-fired oven gives the pizza a distinctive char and smoky flavor that's impossible to replicate any other way. The slight bitterness of the charred spots perfectly balances the sweetness of the sauce.
Perfectly crispy crust,2025-03-18,5,"However they achieve it, their crust has the perfect crispness all the way through - no soggy middle! Even the slices with lots of toppings maintain their structural integrity. Engineering marvel of pizza."
Spicy special was too much,2024-10-14,2,Their 'Firebreather' pizza should come with a warning label. It wasn't enjoyably spicy - it was painfully hot to the point where I couldn't taste anything else. Had to throw most of it away.
Masterful use of olive oil,2024-12-12,5,"The drizzle of high-quality olive oil they add just before serving makes all the difference - adds richness, enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, and adds a wonderful aromatic element. Simple but transformative."
Excellent customer service,2024-10-26,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
Painfully obvious cheap ingredients,2024-09-26,2,"The pre-shredded cheese didn't melt properly, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the sausage had that distinctive processed flavor. At these prices, cutting corners on ingredients is inexcusable."
Masterful use of olive oil,2023-04-08,5,"The drizzle of high-quality olive oil they add just before serving makes all the difference - adds richness, enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, and adds a wonderful aromatic element. Simple but transformative."
Best pizza in town,2024-12-24,5,"The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Their signature pepperoni pizza had the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, and the pepperoni curled up into little cups of deliciousness. Will definitely be back!"
Exceptional sauce-making technique,2025-01-18,5,"You can tell their sauce is made with properly hand-crushed tomatoes - it has that perfect texture with small chunks rather than being completely smooth. The bright flavor suggests minimal cooking, allowing the tomato quality to shine."
Excellent attention to cooking time,2025-03-23,5,They nail the cooking time perfectly - pulling the pizza from the oven at exactly the right moment when the cheese is fully melted and bubbling but not yet browned. Shows expertise and attention to detail.
Dirty restaurant,2023-12-05,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."
Excessive grease pooling,2024-02-28,2,"Had to continuously blot the pizza with napkins as pools of orange grease formed on top of the cheese with every passing minute. By the end, the napkins were completely saturated and transparent. Felt unhealthy even by pizza standards."
Undercooked in the middle,2023-09-05,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."
Dirty restaurant,2023-04-19,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."
Too much emphasis on appearance,2023-04-27,3,"The pizza was clearly designed to look good in photos - perfect symmetry, vibrant colors, photogenic cheese pull - but the flavor was underwhelming. Style over substance for the Instagram crowd."
Crust like cardboard,2024-10-26,2,"The crust had all the flavor and texture of packing material - dry, tough, and completely devoid of character. Even the decent toppings couldn't save it. The foundation of good pizza is good dough, and this wasn't it."
Too expensive for pizza,2025-05-15,3,"The pizza is good, I'll give them that. But $30 for a basic large cheese pizza is highway robbery. Add toppings and you're looking at $40-50. The quality doesn't justify these premium prices."
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2024-08-18,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Amazing Detroit-style,2023-10-20,5,"Their Detroit-style square pizza is incredible - crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior, and those corner pieces are to die for! The pepperoni cup and char perfectly. Worth the 30-minute wait."
Authentic coal-fired perfection,2024-11-25,5,Their coal-fired oven gives the pizza a distinctive char and smoky flavor that's impossible to replicate any other way. The slight bitterness of the charred spots perfectly balances the sweetness of the sauce.
Underwhelming and basic,2023-03-09,3,"Nothing particularly wrong with it, but nothing memorable either. Standard crust, standard sauce, standard toppings. In a city with so many pizza options, this place doesn't give you any reason to return."
Incredible vodka sauce base,2023-02-22,5,"Their vodka sauce pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil is something special. The creamy, slightly spicy sauce is a perfect alternative to traditional tomato sauce. Add prosciutto for an extra flavor dimension!"
Unmelted cheese in the center,2025-02-11,2,"The edges were fine but the center had cold, unmelted cheese - a sign the oven wasn't hot enough or the pizza wasn't cooked long enough. Basic pizza fundamentals seem to be lacking."
Pizza arrived upside-down,2025-02-14,1,Delivery driver must have taken a sharp turn because our pizza arrived completely flipped over in the box - all toppings stuck to the lid. Restaurant offered no solution other than suggesting we 'scrape it off and reassemble it.'
Burnt crust ruins it,2024-03-07,2,"They claim 'char' is part of the Neapolitan experience, but there's a difference between char and burnt. The entire bottom of my pizza was black and bitter. Scraping it off meant losing half the crust."
Perfect for lunch specials,2024-05-07,4,"Their lunch deal is unbeatable - $10 for a 10-inch pizza and small salad. The pizza comes out quickly, is always fresh, and the perfect size for one person. Great place for a work lunch."
Tasteless cheese substitute,2023-01-02,2,"Their vegan cheese option was terrible - had no meltability, a grainy texture, and tasted strongly of coconut which clashed with the tomato sauce. If you can't do vegan cheese well, better to offer cheese-free options that are properly balanced."
Burned mouth on first bite,2025-05-23,2,"They served the pizza dangerously hot - barely out of the oven with no time to cool. Severely burned the roof of my mouth on the first bite, which ruined the rest of the meal and my next few days."
Excellent wine pairings,2024-11-06,5,"Their curated wine list is designed specifically to pair with their pizzas, and the staff is knowledgeable about suggesting the perfect match. The house red with their sausage pizza is a transcendent combination."
Too salty,2023-12-17,2,"Everything I tried was oversalted - the crust, the sauce, and especially the cheese. It was like they were trying to ensure you'd order more drinks. Couldn't finish my pizza and was thirsty all night."
Tough leathery crust,2024-04-02,2,"The crust was so tough I almost couldn't bite through it - like trying to eat leather. The edges were particularly problematic, had to tear pieces off with significant effort. Completely lacks the pleasant chewiness good pizza should have."
Perfect for big groups,2023-01-24,5,"We had a party of 12 and they accommodated us perfectly. Their 20-inch shareable pizzas are great for groups, and they were happy to do half-and-half toppings to please everyone. Service was impressively coordinated."
Cheese solidified too quickly,2025-02-09,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Phenomenal crust,2023-08-30,5,"Whatever they do to their dough is magical - it's got that perfect combination of crispy and chewy with a slight sourdough tang. I could eat their plain crust by itself, it's that good."
Ideal char-to-chew ratio,2023-03-28,5,The small charred bubbles on the crust add amazing flavor without dominating. They've mastered that balance between the slight bitterness of char and the natural sweetness of the dough. Technical perfection!
Greasy and disappointing,2023-02-03,2,"I had high hopes based on the reviews, but my pizza was swimming in grease. The crust was undercooked in the center, and the promised 'fresh vegetables' looked and tasted canned. Such a letdown."
Exceptional spinach ricotta pie,2025-06-07,5,Their white pizza with spinach and ricotta is exceptional - the creamy richness of the cheese balanced by the slight bitterness of the greens. The garlic-infused olive oil base ties everything together perfectly.
Too much salt in the dough,2024-03-04,2,The crust was so salty it was almost inedible - overwhelmed all the other flavors and left me incredibly thirsty afterward. A heavy hand with salt ruined what could have been a good pizza.
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2025-01-28,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2025-03-04,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
Cheese solidified too quickly,2023-03-30,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Excessive grease pooling,2024-02-11,2,"Had to continuously blot the pizza with napkins as pools of orange grease formed on top of the cheese with every passing minute. By the end, the napkins were completely saturated and transparent. Felt unhealthy even by pizza standards."

Too thin to be satisfying,2023-12-31,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Crust like cardboard,2023-04-03,2,"The crust had all the flavor and texture of packing material - dry, tough, and completely devoid of character. Even the decent toppings couldn't save it. The foundation of good pizza is good dough, and this wasn't it."

Righteous ranch drizzle,2023-06-01,5,Their house-made ranch drizzle takes their pizzas to another level. It's not your typical ranch - has hints of dill and garlic with a perfect consistency that adds creaminess without making things soggy.
Perfect for dietary restrictions,2023-11-13,5,"As someone with multiple food allergies, I appreciate that they take dietary concerns seriously. Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"
Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2025-04-30,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies. The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."

Tough leathery crust,2025-05-02,2,"The crust was so tough I almost couldn't bite through it - like trying to eat leather. The edges were particularly problematic, had to tear pieces off with significant effort. Completely lacks the pleasant chewiness good pizza should have."
Inconsistent quality,2023-01-08,3,I've been here three times. First visit: amazing. Second: terrible. Third: just okay. Seems like it really depends on who's working that day. Wish they could maintain better quality control.
Too greasy to enjoy,2024-02-23,2,"Had to literally blot my pizza with napkins, which came away completely saturated with grease. Whatever flavor might have been there was drowned in oil. Couldn't finish it as it was making me feel ill."
Too much cheese,2025-02-19,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Sloppy presentation,2024-05-22,3,"The pizza looked like it had been assembled in a hurry - toppings haphazardly thrown on, cheese unevenly distributed, and the cutting was so uneven that some slices were twice the size of others. Taste was okay, but appearance matters too."
Perfect for watching sports,2023-02-10,4,"Great setup with TVs visible from every table, excellent pitcher specials during games, and their 'Game Day' pizza loaded with multiple meats and jalapeños is the perfect sports-watching food. Atmosphere gets lively but not obnoxious."
Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2024-08-24,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies. The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."
Epic meat lovers option,2023-04-15,4,"If you're a carnivore, their 'Butcher's Block' pizza is incredible. Five different meats, all high quality - the soppressata and house-made sausage are standouts. Just be ready for a food coma afterward!"
Authentic coal-fired perfection,2025-01-31,5,Their coal-fired oven gives the pizza a distinctive char and smoky flavor that's impossible to replicate any other way. The slight bitterness of the charred spots perfectly balances the sweetness of the sauce.
Authentic Italian experience,2023-07-07,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
Disappointed with service,2023-06-04,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."
Toppings slide right off,2024-08-09,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Perfectly crispy crust,2023-07-16,5,"However they achieve it, their crust has the perfect crispness all the way through - no soggy middle! Even the slices with lots of toppings maintain their structural integrity. Engineering marvel of pizza."
Ideal char-to-chew ratio,2023-11-04,5,The small charred bubbles on the crust add amazing flavor without dominating. They've mastered that balance between the slight bitterness of char and the natural sweetness of the dough. Technical perfection!
Excellent beer pairing suggestions,2024-07-10,5,"Not only is their pizza excellent (try the fig and prosciutto!), but the staff is knowledgeable about their craft beer selection and can suggest the perfect pairing for whatever pizza you order."
Undercooked in the middle,2024-01-01,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."
Excellent attention to cooking time,2023-04-12,5,They nail the cooking time perfectly - pulling the pizza from the oven at exactly the right moment when the cheese is fully melted and bubbling but not yet browned. Shows expertise and attention to detail.
Overpriced for what you get,2023-07-13,3,"$24 for a medium pizza with just two toppings seems excessive. The ingredients were fresh and the crust was good, but nothing justified the premium price. There are better values elsewhere in town."
Masterful use of olive oil,2023-01-12,5,"The drizzle of high-quality olive oil they add just before serving makes all the difference - adds richness, enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, and adds a wonderful aromatic element. Simple but transformative."

Brilliant use of fermented dough,2025-03-22,5,Their 72-hour fermented dough has incredible depth of flavor with subtle sourdough notes. The extended fermentation creates a complex web of flavors and perfect texture that you simply can't achieve with quick-rise methods.
Mediocre at best,2024-02-14,3,"Nothing terrible but nothing special either. The crust was okay, toppings were standard, and service was fine. It's the kind of place you go when you're in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip for."
Family night favorite,2024-10-06,5,"We bring our kids here every Friday night. The staff always make them feel special, providing dough for them to play with while we wait. Their kid-sized pizzas are perfect, and the parents love the craft beer selection."
Rude staff ruined the meal,2024-05-19,2,"The pizza itself was decent, but the counter staff was incredibly rude - sighing when I asked questions about ingredients, rushing my order, and actually rolling their eyes when I requested extra napkins."
Too much garlic,2024-08-16,3,"I love garlic but this was excessive - felt like they mistook cloves for teaspoons in the recipe. My breath was lethal afterward, and the powerful flavor overwhelmed the other ingredients."
Inconsistent quality,2023-03-13,3,I've been here three times. First visit: amazing. Second: terrible. Third: just okay. Seems like it really depends on who's working that day. Wish they could maintain better quality control.
Excellent Chicago deep dish,2025-03-15,5,"Hard to find authentic Chicago-style pizza in this area, but they nail it. The buttery, flaky crust, the layering of cheese under the sauce, the chunky tomato topping - all perfect. Worth the 45-minute cook time."
Way too much oregano,2025-02-24,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
Too much sauce,2024-10-07,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Late night savior,2023-03-25,4,"Open until 2am on weekends, this place has saved me many times after a night out. Their slices are huge, reheated perfectly crisp, and they have creative toppings that hit the spot when you're hungry late at night."
Too expensive for pizza,2024-12-27,3,"The pizza is good, I'll give them that. But $30 for a basic large cheese pizza is highway robbery. Add toppings and you're looking at $40-50. The quality doesn't justify these premium prices."
Best pizza in town,2023-08-02,5,"The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Their signature pepperoni pizza had the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, and the pepperoni curled up into little cups of deliciousness. Will definitely be back!"
Dirty restaurant,2025-05-25,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."

Supreme quality control,2024-08-25,5,"Visited multiple times and the consistency is impressive - every pizza comes out identical to the last one, with the same excellent quality. Shows serious commitment to training and standards that's rare in casual dining."
Skimpy on toppings,2023-07-30,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."
Authentic coal-fired perfection,2025-03-30,5,Their coal-fired oven gives the pizza a distinctive char and smoky flavor that's impossible to replicate any other way. The slight bitterness of the charred spots perfectly balances the sweetness of the sauce.
Best Hawaiian in the city,2023-09-05,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."

Tiny portion sizes,2023-05-05,2,"Their 'personal' pizza is the size of a CD. For $15, I expected something that would actually satisfy my hunger. Had to order a second one, turning a quick lunch into an expensive disappointment."
No-cheese option was all sauce,2023-08-24,2,"Ordered a cheese-free pizza for my dairy-allergic friend, but they made no adjustments - just removed the cheese and left a soggy sauce-covered bread. Good pizza without cheese requires rebalancing other elements."
Masterful use of olive oil,2025-05-08,5,"The drizzle of high-quality olive oil they add just before serving makes all the difference - adds richness, enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, and adds a wonderful aromatic element. Simple but transformative."

Way too much crust,2023-06-22,2,The edge crust (cornicione) was comically large - almost half of each slice was just bread with no toppings. This ratio of crust to actual pizza was way off and made for a disappointing experience.
Righteous ranch drizzle,2023-09-13,5,Their house-made ranch drizzle takes their pizzas to another level. It's not your typical ranch - has hints of dill and garlic with a perfect consistency that adds creaminess without making things soggy.
Excellent beer pairing suggestions,2024-03-12,5,"Not only is their pizza excellent (try the fig and prosciutto!), but the staff is knowledgeable about their craft beer selection and can suggest the perfect pairing for whatever pizza you order."
New owners ruined it,2023-04-26,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."
Hidden gem for vegans,2024-12-31,5,"I can't believe how good their vegan pizza is! They make their own cashew cheese that actually melts properly, and their vegetable toppings are always fresh and seasonal. Even my non-vegan friends love it."
Excellent customer service,2025-03-13,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
Sloppy presentation,2024-06-21,3,"The pizza looked like it had been assembled in a hurry - toppings haphazardly thrown on, cheese unevenly distributed, and the cutting was so uneven that some slices were twice the size of others. Taste was okay, but appearance matters too."
Crust like cardboard,2023-08-08,2,"The crust had all the flavor and texture of packing material - dry, tough, and completely devoid of character. Even the decent toppings couldn't save it. The foundation of good pizza is good dough, and this wasn't it."
Too much emphasis on appearance,2023-05-23,3,"The pizza was clearly designed to look good in photos - perfect symmetry, vibrant colors, photogenic cheese pull - but the flavor was underwhelming. Style over substance for the Instagram crowd."
Excellent for takeout,2023-07-01,4,"Their pizza travels remarkably well. Even after a 20-minute drive home, the crust was still crispy and everything was at the perfect temperature. They have their packaging technique down to a science."
Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2024-05-30,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
Inconsistent quality,2024-08-27,3,I've been here three times. First visit: amazing. Second: terrible. Third: just okay. Seems like it really depends on who's working that day. Wish they could maintain better quality control.
Crispy yet chewy perfection,2023-07-03,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."
Too much salt in the dough,2025-06-15,2,The crust was so salty it was almost inedible - overwhelmed all the other flavors and left me incredibly thirsty afterward. A heavy hand with salt ruined what could have been a good pizza.
Not worth the wait,2023-03-10,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."
Terrible delivery experience,2025-06-01,1,"Ordered for Valentine's Day and regretted it. Pizza took 2 hours to arrive, was cold, and had the wrong toppings. Called the restaurant and they seemed completely unconcerned. Never again."
Ideal char-to-chew ratio,2023-10-18,5,The small charred bubbles on the crust add amazing flavor without dominating. They've mastered that balance between the slight bitterness of char and the natural sweetness of the dough. Technical perfection!
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2024-07-05,5,They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!
Exceptional sauce-making technique,2025-05-10,5,"You can tell their sauce is made with properly hand-crushed tomatoes - it has that perfect texture with small chunks rather than being completely smooth. The bright flavor suggests minimal cooking, allowing the tomato quality to shine."
Too much emphasis on appearance,2023-04-21,3,"The pizza was clearly designed to look good in photos - perfect symmetry, vibrant colors, photogenic cheese pull - but the flavor was underwhelming. Style over substance for the Instagram crowd."

Fresh ingredients make the difference,2024-07-09,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Absurdly small slices,2025-04-30,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."
Too thin to be satisfying,2025-02-09,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Perfect for watching sports,2024-02-05,4,"Great setup with TVs visible from every table, excellent pitcher specials during games, and their 'Game Day' pizza loaded with multiple meats and jalapeños is the perfect sports-watching food. Atmosphere gets lively but not obnoxious."
Supreme quality control,2023-09-25,5,"Visited multiple times and the consistency is impressive - every pizza comes out identical to the last one, with the same excellent quality. Shows serious commitment to training and standards that's rare in casual dining."
Masterclass in proper baking,2024-08-29,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
Magnificent flavor layering,2025-04-12,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Lackluster veggie options,2025-05-16,3,"Their vegetable toppings lacked freshness and flavor - the mushrooms were clearly canned, the peppers were soft and faded, and the onions were sparse. Disappointing for a place that advertises farm-fresh ingredients."
Too much cheese,2024-05-18,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Perfect buffalo mozzarella application,2024-07-10,5,They understand that buffalo mozzarella shouldn't be cooked too long or it loses its distinctive texture and flavor. Applied in dollops after the pizza is mostly baked so it just barely melts while maintaining its creamy integrity. Technical perfection!
Too much salt in the dough,2023-06-25,2,The crust was so salty it was almost inedible - overwhelmed all the other flavors and left me incredibly thirsty afterward. A heavy hand with salt ruined what could have been a good pizza.
Terrible delivery experience,2023-05-31,1,"Ordered for Valentine's Day and regretted it. Pizza took 2 hours to arrive, was cold, and had the wrong toppings. Called the restaurant and they seemed completely unconcerned. Never again."
Tasteless cheese substitute,2025-01-21,2,"Their vegan cheese option was terrible - had no meltability, a grainy texture, and tasted strongly of coconut which clashed with the tomato sauce. If you can't do vegan cheese well, better to offer cheese-free options that are properly balanced."
Masterclass in proper baking,2023-07-21,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
Creative seasonal specials,2024-06-11,5,"Just had their spring special with asparagus, lemon ricotta, and prosciutto. The combination was bright, fresh, and perfect for the season. Love that they use local, seasonal ingredients."

Applied in dollops after the pizza is mostly baked so it just barely melts while maintaining its creamy integrity. Technical perfection!
Perfect for big groups,2023-01-30,5,"We had a party of 12 and they accommodated us perfectly. Their 20-inch shareable pizzas are great for groups, and they were happy to do half-and-half toppings to please everyone. Service was impressively coordinated."
Righteous ranch drizzle,2024-02-22,5,Their house-made ranch drizzle takes their pizzas to another level. It's not your typical ranch - has hints of dill and garlic with a perfect consistency that adds creaminess without making things soggy.
Crispy yet chewy perfection,2023-05-05,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."
Perfect crunch factor,2023-04-01,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."
Doughy and undercooked,2024-07-24,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Burned mouth on first bite,2023-12-02,2,"They served the pizza dangerously hot - barely out of the oven with no time to cool. Severely burned the roof of my mouth on the first bite, which ruined the rest of the meal and my next few days."
Amazing Detroit-style,2023-01-16,5,"Their Detroit-style square pizza is incredible - crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior, and those corner pieces are to die for! The pepperoni cup and char perfectly. Worth the 30-minute wait."
Perfect for picky eaters,2024-01-28,4,Their 'build your own quarter' option is genius - a large pizza divided into quadrants with different toppings. Perfect for our family where everyone wants something different. No more ordering multiple pizzas!
Skimpy on toppings,2024-05-28,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."
Perfect for large parties,2023-12-29,5,"Their party package is fantastic - multiple 18-inch pizzas with varied toppings, plenty of sides, and they were accommodating with our group of 20. Everything arrived hot and on time, and they included all the necessary paper goods."
Expert-level pizza folding,2024-10-06,5,Their thin-crust slices fold perfectly New York-style without cracking or losing toppings. The slight resistance before the fold is exactly what you want - showing the perfect balance of crisp and chew.
Masterclass in proper baking,2023-11-05,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
Mediocre at best,2024-02-20,3,"Nothing terrible but nothing special either. The crust was okay, toppings were standard, and service was fine. It's the kind of place you go when you're in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip for."
Cheese solidified too quickly,2023-10-05,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Superior ingredients make the difference,2023-07-30,5,"They import their flour from Italy, use San Marzano tomatoes, and make their mozzarella in-house daily. The commitment to quality ingredients is evident in every bite - nothing is an afterthought."
Outstanding wood-fired perfection,2023-10-02,5,The wood-fired oven gives their pizza a distinctive smoky complexity you can't get any other way. The slight char adds bitterness that balances the sweetness of the sauce perfectly. Worth seeking out for this unique flavor profile.
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2024-05-28,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."

Perfect balance of flavors,2024-07-05,5,"Their 'Mediterranean' pizza has the perfect balance of flavors - the briny olives, tangy feta, fresh tomatoes, and herb-infused olive oil all complement each other without any one element overwhelming the others."
Too salty,2025-05-13,2,"Everything I tried was oversalted - the crust, the sauce, and especially the cheese. It was like they were trying to ensure you'd order more drinks. Couldn't finish my pizza and was thirsty all night."
Great gluten-free option,2024-09-22,4,"As someone with celiac disease, finding good gluten-free pizza is a challenge. Their cauliflower crust was one of the best I've had - doesn't fall apart and has a nice flavor. Toppings were generous too."
Outstanding variety of options,2023-04-20,5,"Their menu has something for everyone - traditional options done well, creative specialties, and customizable choices. Even have dessert pizzas that are surprisingly good (try the Nutella and banana!)."
Lackluster veggie options,2024-06-12,3,"Their vegetable toppings lacked freshness and flavor - the mushrooms were clearly canned, the peppers were soft and faded, and the onions were sparse. Disappointing for a place that advertises farm-fresh ingredients."
Painfully obvious cheap ingredients,2023-10-07,2,"The pre-shredded cheese didn't melt properly, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the sausage had that distinctive processed flavor. At these prices, cutting corners on ingredients is inexcusable."
Tasteless cheese substitute,2024-10-24,2,"Their vegan cheese option was terrible - had no meltability, a grainy texture, and tasted strongly of coconut which clashed with the tomato sauce. If you can't do vegan cheese well, better to offer cheese-free options that are properly balanced."
Perfect for big groups,2025-02-04,5,"We had a party of 12 and they accommodated us perfectly. Their 20-inch shareable pizzas are great for groups, and they were happy to do half-and-half toppings to please everyone. Service was impressively coordinated."
Weird aftertaste,2023-08-17,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."
Ideal char-to-chew ratio,2023-01-09,5,The small charred bubbles on the crust add amazing flavor without dominating. They've mastered that balance between the slight bitterness of char and the natural sweetness of the dough. Technical perfection!
Perfect temperature every time,2024-02-05,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
Best white pizza ever,2023-02-20,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2023-05-21,5,They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!
Perfectly crispy crust,2023-06-29,5,"However they achieve it, their crust has the perfect crispness all the way through - no soggy middle! Even the slices with lots of toppings maintain their structural integrity. Engineering marvel of pizza."
Best white pizza ever,2024-04-11,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"
Stale-tasting crust,2025-05-15,2,"The crust had a stale, almost cardboard-like quality that suggests either old dough or old flour. Fresh ingredients on top couldn't compensate for the foundation being off."
Perfect for late-night cravings,2024-11-12,5,"Open until 3am on weekends, this place has saved many late nights. The slices are huge, they reheat them perfectly so they're crispy, and their special late-night menu items are creative and delicious."
Outstanding wood-fired perfection,2024-09-29,5,The wood-fired oven gives their pizza a distinctive smoky complexity you can't get any other way. The slight char adds bitterness that balances the sweetness of the sauce perfectly. Worth seeking out for this unique flavor profile.
Greasy and disappointing,2023-12-28,2,"I had high hopes based on the reviews, but my pizza was swimming in grease. The crust was undercooked in the center, and the promised 'fresh vegetables' looked and tasted canned. Such a letdown."
Undercooked in the middle,2024-11-29,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."
Incredible vodka sauce base,2023-10-15,5,"Their vodka sauce pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil is something special. The creamy, slightly spicy sauce is a perfect alternative to traditional tomato sauce. Add prosciutto for an extra flavor dimension!"
Great gluten-free option,2023-04-20,4,"As someone with celiac disease, finding good gluten-free pizza is a challenge. Their cauliflower crust was one of the best I've had - doesn't fall apart and has a nice flavor. Toppings were generous too."

Burned mouth on first bite,2023-05-06,2,"They served the pizza dangerously hot - barely out of the oven with no time to cool. Severely burned the roof of my mouth on the first bite, which ruined the rest of the meal and my next few days."
Disappointed with service,2023-01-03,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."
Doughy and undercooked,2024-12-04,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Exceptional sauce-making technique,2023-03-31,5,"You can tell their sauce is made with properly hand-crushed tomatoes - it has that perfect texture with small chunks rather than being completely smooth. The bright flavor suggests minimal cooking, allowing the tomato quality to shine."
Epic meat lovers option,2023-02-19,4,"If you're a carnivore, their 'Butcher's Block' pizza is incredible. Five different meats, all high quality - the soppressata and house-made sausage are standouts. Just be ready for a food coma afterward!"
Outstanding wood-fired perfection,2023-08-27,5,The wood-fired oven gives their pizza a distinctive smoky complexity you can't get any other way. The slight char adds bitterness that balances the sweetness of the sauce perfectly. Worth seeking out for this unique flavor profile.
Unmelted cheese in the center,2024-01-21,2,"The edges were fine but the center had cold, unmelted cheese - a sign the oven wasn't hot enough or the pizza wasn't cooked long enough. Basic pizza fundamentals seem to be lacking."
Best Hawaiian in the city,2023-12-29,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."
Too much garlic,2024-12-10,3,"I love garlic but this was excessive - felt like they mistook cloves for teaspoons in the recipe. My breath was lethal afterward, and the powerful flavor overwhelmed the other ingredients."
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2023-08-01,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."
Perfect for picky eaters,2024-12-03,4,Their 'build your own quarter' option is genius - a large pizza divided into quadrants with different toppings. Perfect for our family where everyone wants something different. No more ordering multiple pizzas!

Exceptional sauce-making technique,2023-04-03,5,"You can tell their sauce is made with properly hand-crushed tomatoes - it has that perfect texture with small chunks rather than being completely smooth. The bright flavor suggests minimal cooking, allowing the tomato quality to shine."
Greasy and disappointing,2023-10-04,2,"I had high hopes based on the reviews, but my pizza was swimming in grease. The crust was undercooked in the center, and the promised 'fresh vegetables' looked and tasted canned. Such a letdown."
False advertising on ingredients,2024-03-10,1,"Menu promised 'house-made Italian sausage' but what came on my pizza was clearly pre-formed, uniform pellets of commercial sausage. When questioned, staff admitted they don't make any ingredients in-house despite menu claims."
Excellent beer pairing suggestions,2024-11-30,5,"Not only is their pizza excellent (try the fig and prosciutto!), but the staff is knowledgeable about their craft beer selection and can suggest the perfect pairing for whatever pizza you order."

Perfect temperature every time,2023-03-08,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
Toppings slide right off,2025-01-20,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
No-cheese option was all sauce,2024-11-18,2,"Ordered a cheese-free pizza for my dairy-allergic friend, but they made no adjustments - just removed the cheese and left a soggy sauce-covered bread. Good pizza without cheese requires rebalancing other elements."
Cheese solidified too quickly,2025-04-13,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Magnificent flavor layering,2023-01-05,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2024-08-01,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies. The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."
Perfect for kids' parties,2024-12-19,5,"Hosted my son's birthday here and it was fantastic. They did a dough-tossing demonstration for the kids, let them make their own mini pizzas, and the staff was incredibly patient and kind."
Mediocre at best,2023-02-19,3,"Nothing terrible but nothing special either. The crust was okay, toppings were standard, and service was fine. It's the kind of place you go when you're in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip for."
Innovative flavor combinations,2023-02-10,5,"Their 'Avant Garde' menu section features combinations I would never have thought of but somehow work perfectly. The pear, gorgonzola, walnut, and honey pizza was a revelation of sweet, salty, and savory harmony."
No flavor distinction,2025-06-02,3,Ordered two completely different specialty pizzas but they somehow tasted nearly identical. It's like they use the same base for everything and the toppings don't impart enough distinctive character.
Too much cheese,2023-05-21,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Sauce like ketchup,2024-06-01,2,"The sauce was suspiciously sweet and one-dimensional, reminiscent of ketchup rather than a proper pizza sauce. No evidence of herbs, garlic, or any complexity. Ruined what otherwise could have been a decent pizza."
Dirty restaurant,2024-07-27,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."
Not enough cheese,2024-02-21,3,"The sauce and crust were good, but they're stingy with cheese. You could see the sauce through the sparse cheese layer, and what was there didn't have that stretchy pull you want from a good pizza."
Not worth the wait,2024-04-19,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."
Weird aftertaste,2025-01-15,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."

Refrigerated dough taste,2024-02-29,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2023-12-06,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Excellent attention to cooking time,2023-07-21,5,They nail the cooking time perfectly - pulling the pizza from the oven at exactly the right moment when the cheese is fully melted and bubbling but not yet browned. Shows expertise and attention to detail.
Exceptional sauce-making technique,2024-12-18,5,"You can tell their sauce is made with properly hand-crushed tomatoes - it has that perfect texture with small chunks rather than being completely smooth. The bright flavor suggests minimal cooking, allowing the tomato quality to shine."
Tomato sauce tasted rancid,2025-02-19,1,"The sauce had a distinctly off flavor that suggested the tomatoes had gone bad before processing. After two bites, couldn't continue eating as the rancid notes became more pronounced. Basic food safety seems questionable."
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2024-12-16,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Weird aftertaste,2024-01-13,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."
No flavor distinction,2023-01-02,3,Ordered two completely different specialty pizzas but they somehow tasted nearly identical. It's like they use the same base for everything and the toppings don't impart enough distinctive character.
Doughy and undercooked,2024-12-19,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Way too much oregano,2024-06-17,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
Pizza arrived upside-down,2024-12-31,1,Delivery driver must have taken a sharp turn because our pizza arrived completely flipped over in the box - all toppings stuck to the lid. Restaurant offered no solution other than suggesting we 'scrape it off and reassemble it.'
Exceptional spinach ricotta pie,2025-04-17,5,Their white pizza with spinach and ricotta is exceptional - the creamy richness of the cheese balanced by the slight bitterness of the greens. The garlic-infused olive oil base ties everything together perfectly.
Stale-tasting crust,2024-07-21,2,"The crust had a stale, almost cardboard-like quality that suggests either old dough or old flour. Fresh ingredients on top couldn't compensate for the foundation being off."
Perfect pepperoni placement,2024-04-03,5,"As a pepperoni perfectionist, I appreciate that they space the pepperoni so every bite gets one full piece. No bare spots or clumped areas. Shows attention to detail that elevates the whole experience."
Masterful use of olive oil,2023-12-22,5,"The drizzle of high-quality olive oil they add just before serving makes all the difference - adds richness, enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, and adds a wonderful aromatic element. Simple but transformative."
Way too much crust,2024-05-05,2,The edge crust (cornicione) was comically large - almost half of each slice was just bread with no toppings. This ratio of crust to actual pizza was way off and made for a disappointing experience.
Tiny portion sizes,2024-11-05,2,"Their 'personal' pizza is the size of a CD. For $15, I expected something that would actually satisfy my hunger. Had to order a second one, turning a quick lunch into an expensive disappointment."
Disappointed with service,2023-06-22,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."
Magnificent flavor layering,2023-10-16,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Mediocre at best,2024-08-29,3,"Nothing terrible but nothing special either. The crust was okay, toppings were standard, and service was fine. It's the kind of place you go when you're in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip for."
Family night favorite,2024-06-24,5,"We bring our kids here every Friday night. The staff always make them feel special, providing dough for them to play with while we wait. Their kid-sized pizzas are perfect, and the parents love the craft beer selection."
Too salty,2024-07-21,2,"Everything I tried was oversalted - the crust, the sauce, and especially the cheese. It was like they were trying to ensure you'd order more drinks. Couldn't finish my pizza and was thirsty all night."
Perfectly crispy crust,2025-04-15,5,"However they achieve it, their crust has the perfect crispness all the way through - no soggy middle! Even the slices with lots of toppings maintain their structural integrity. Engineering marvel of pizza."
Best pizza in town,2025-05-09,5,"The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Their signature pepperoni pizza had the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, and the pepperoni curled up into little cups of deliciousness. Will definitely be back!"
All style no substance,2025-02-07,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."
Perfect for big groups,2024-09-30,5,"We had a party of 12 and they accommodated us perfectly. Their 20-inch shareable pizzas are great for groups, and they were happy to do half-and-half toppings to please everyone. Service was impressively coordinated."
Outstanding wood-fired perfection,2024-01-26,5,The wood-fired oven gives their pizza a distinctive smoky complexity you can't get any other way. The slight char adds bitterness that balances the sweetness of the sauce perfectly. Worth seeking out for this unique flavor profile.
Painfully obvious cheap ingredients,2024-04-12,2,"The pre-shredded cheese didn't melt properly, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the sausage had that distinctive processed flavor. At these prices, cutting corners on ingredients is inexcusable."
Too expensive for pizza,2025-01-17,3,"The pizza is good, I'll give them that. But $30 for a basic large cheese pizza is highway robbery. Add toppings and you're looking at $40-50. The quality doesn't justify these premium prices."
Perfect for large parties,2023-10-17,5,"Their party package is fantastic - multiple 18-inch pizzas with varied toppings, plenty of sides, and they were accommodating with our group of 20. Everything arrived hot and on time, and they included all the necessary paper goods."
Perfect for kids' parties,2023-07-05,5,"Hosted my son's birthday here and it was fantastic. They did a dough-tossing demonstration for the kids, let them make their own mini pizzas, and the staff was incredibly patient and kind."
Innovative toppings,2023-05-26,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."
Stale-tasting crust,2025-02-07,2,"The crust had a stale, almost cardboard-like quality that suggests either old dough or old flour. Fresh ingredients on top couldn't compensate for the foundation being off."
Innovative toppings,2024-07-15,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."
Cheese solidified too quickly,2024-02-24,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Stale-tasting crust,2025-02-09,2,"The crust had a stale, almost cardboard-like quality that suggests either old dough or old flour. Fresh ingredients on top couldn't compensate for the foundation being off."
Expert-level pizza folding,2023-02-28,5,Their thin-crust slices fold perfectly New York-style without cracking or losing toppings. The slight resistance before the fold is exactly what you want - showing the perfect balance of crisp and chew.
Late night savior,2023-07-13,4,"Open until 2am on weekends, this place has saved me many times after a night out. Their slices are huge, reheated perfectly crisp, and they have creative toppings that hit the spot when you're hungry late at night."
All style no substance,2024-05-14,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."
Perfect for watching sports,2024-06-07,4,"Great setup with TVs visible from every table, excellent pitcher specials during games, and their 'Game Day' pizza loaded with multiple meats and jalapeños is the perfect sports-watching food. Atmosphere gets lively but not obnoxious."
Too much emphasis on appearance,2024-08-01,3,"The pizza was clearly designed to look good in photos - perfect symmetry, vibrant colors, photogenic cheese pull - but the flavor was underwhelming. Style over substance for the Instagram crowd."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2025-01-13,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Phenomenal crust,2024-06-03,5,"Whatever they do to their dough is magical - it's got that perfect combination of crispy and chewy with a slight sourdough tang. I could eat their plain crust by itself, it's that good."
Absurdly small slices,2025-05-30,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."
Perfect NY-style slices,2024-05-06,5,"As a transplant from NYC, I've been searching for authentic NY-style pizza. This place nails it - thin, foldable slices with the right amount of chew and grease. Their plain cheese slice is perfection."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2024-10-15,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Too expensive for pizza,2023-03-11,3,"The pizza is good, I'll give them that. But $30 for a basic large cheese pizza is highway robbery. Add toppings and you're looking at $40-50. The quality doesn't justify these premium prices."
Too thin to be satisfying,2023-04-01,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2024-07-03,5,They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!
Too greasy to enjoy,2024-06-15,2,"Had to literally blot my pizza with napkins, which came away completely saturated with grease. Whatever flavor might have been there was drowned in oil. Couldn't finish it as it was making me feel ill."
Perfect textural contrast,2024-11-03,5,"The contrast between the crisp bottom, the tender interior crumb, the gooey cheese, and the slight resistance of the toppings creates a textural symphony. Each bite is interesting and satisfying in a different way."
Cheese solidified too quickly,2024-09-01,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Excellent wine pairings,2024-10-06,5,"Their curated wine list is designed specifically to pair with their pizzas, and the staff is knowledgeable about suggesting the perfect match. The house red with their sausage pizza is a transcendent combination."
Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2025-03-27,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
Too much salt in the dough,2024-08-25,2,The crust was so salty it was almost inedible - overwhelmed all the other flavors and left me incredibly thirsty afterward. A heavy hand with salt ruined what could have been a good pizza.
Amazing Detroit-style,2025-03-21,5,"Their Detroit-style square pizza is incredible - crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior, and those corner pieces are to die for! The pepperoni cup and char perfectly. Worth the 30-minute wait."
All style no substance,2025-01-17,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."
Supreme quality control,2023-10-20,5,"Visited multiple times and the consistency is impressive - every pizza comes out identical to the last one, with the same excellent quality. Shows serious commitment to training and standards that's rare in casual dining."
Masterclass in proper baking,2025-01-30,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
False advertising on size,2025-05-31,2,"Their menu clearly states that a large pizza is 16 inches, but what we received couldn't have been more than 14 inches. When questioned, they claimed their menu was outdated but refused any adjustment."
No-cheese option was all sauce,2024-11-23,2,"Ordered a cheese-free pizza for my dairy-allergic friend, but they made no adjustments - just removed the cheese and left a soggy sauce-covered bread. Good pizza without cheese requires rebalancing other elements."
Burned bottom raw top,2024-09-28,1,The bottom of the crust was completely black while the cheese on top wasn't fully melted. This temperature imbalance suggests serious issues with their oven management and pizza-making technique.
Family night favorite,2025-01-07,5,"We bring our kids here every Friday night. The staff always make them feel special, providing dough for them to play with while we wait. Their kid-sized pizzas are perfect, and the parents love the craft beer selection."
Cold center burnt edges,2024-02-01,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Too expensive for pizza,2023-04-21,3,"The pizza is good, I'll give them that. But $30 for a basic large cheese pizza is highway robbery. Add toppings and you're looking at $40-50. The quality doesn't justify these premium prices."
Perfect for late-night cravings,2023-08-24,5,"Open until 3am on weekends, this place has saved many late nights. The slices are huge, they reheat them perfectly so they're crispy, and their special late-night menu items are creative and delicious."
Burned mouth on first bite,2023-05-28,2,"They served the pizza dangerously hot - barely out of the oven with no time to cool. Severely burned the roof of my mouth on the first bite, which ruined the rest of the meal and my next few days."
Supreme quality control,2023-07-23,5,"Visited multiple times and the consistency is impressive - every pizza comes out identical to the last one, with the same excellent quality. Shows serious commitment to training and standards that's rare in casual dining."
Perfect for lunch specials,2024-09-03,4,"Their lunch deal is unbeatable - $10 for a 10-inch pizza and small salad. The pizza comes out quickly, is always fresh, and the perfect size for one person. Great place for a work lunch."
Ideal char-to-chew ratio,2024-11-19,5,The small charred bubbles on the crust add amazing flavor without dominating. They've mastered that balance between the slight bitterness of char and the natural sweetness of the dough. Technical perfection!
Too thin to be satisfying,2024-02-08,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Refrigerated dough taste,2023-02-06,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."
Superior ingredients make the difference,2023-06-12,5,"They import their flour from Italy, use San Marzano tomatoes, and make their mozzarella in-house daily. The commitment to quality ingredients is evident in every bite - nothing is an afterthought."
Excellent Chicago deep dish,2025-05-04,5,"Hard to find authentic Chicago-style pizza in this area, but they nail it. The buttery, flaky crust, the layering of cheese under the sauce, the chunky tomato topping - all perfect. Worth the 45-minute cook time."
Not enough cheese,2025-02-17,3,"The sauce and crust were good, but they're stingy with cheese. You could see the sauce through the sparse cheese layer, and what was there didn't have that stretchy pull you want from a good pizza."
Outstanding variety of options,2023-08-01,5,"Their menu has something for everyone - traditional options done well, creative specialties, and customizable choices. Even have dessert pizzas that are surprisingly good (try the Nutella and banana!)."
Exceptional spinach ricotta pie,2024-04-12,5,Their white pizza with spinach and ricotta is exceptional - the creamy richness of the cheese balanced by the slight bitterness of the greens. The garlic-infused olive oil base ties everything together perfectly.
All style no substance,2024-09-09,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."

Great gluten-free option,2025-05-25,4,"As someone with celiac disease, finding good gluten-free pizza is a challenge. Their cauliflower crust was one of the best I've had - doesn't fall apart and has a nice flavor. Toppings were generous too."
Doughy and undercooked,2025-01-17,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Undercooked in the middle,2025-03-27,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."
Magnificent flavor layering,2023-04-17,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Hidden gem for vegans,2023-12-19,5,"I can't believe how good their vegan pizza is! They make their own cashew cheese that actually melts properly, and their vegetable toppings are always fresh and seasonal. Even my non-vegan friends love it."
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2023-09-14,5,They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!

Excellent for takeout,2023-01-03,4,"Their pizza travels remarkably well. Even after a 20-minute drive home, the crust was still crispy and everything was at the perfect temperature. They have their packaging technique down to a science."
Stale-tasting crust,2023-12-27,2,"The crust had a stale, almost cardboard-like quality that suggests either old dough or old flour. Fresh ingredients on top couldn't compensate for the foundation being off."
Sloppy presentation,2023-02-19,3,"The pizza looked like it had been assembled in a hurry - toppings haphazardly thrown on, cheese unevenly distributed, and the cutting was so uneven that some slices were twice the size of others. Taste was okay, but appearance matters too."
Too salty,2024-04-20,2,"Everything I tried was oversalted - the crust, the sauce, and especially the cheese. It was like they were trying to ensure you'd order more drinks. Couldn't finish my pizza and was thirsty all night."
Exceptional sauce-making technique,2025-01-19,5,"You can tell their sauce is made with properly hand-crushed tomatoes - it has that perfect texture with small chunks rather than being completely smooth. The bright flavor suggests minimal cooking, allowing the tomato quality to shine."

New owners ruined it,2023-08-03,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."
Toppings slide right off,2024-07-19,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Burned bottom raw top,2025-04-10,1,The bottom of the crust was completely black while the cheese on top wasn't fully melted. This temperature imbalance suggests serious issues with their oven management and pizza-making technique.

Too much sauce,2024-11-13,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Incredible vodka sauce base,2025-02-06,5,"Their vodka sauce pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil is something special. The creamy, slightly spicy sauce is a perfect alternative to traditional tomato sauce. Add prosciutto for an extra flavor dimension!"
Sloppy presentation,2023-04-23,3,"The pizza looked like it had been assembled in a hurry - toppings haphazardly thrown on, cheese unevenly distributed, and the cutting was so uneven that some slices were twice the size of others. Taste was okay, but appearance matters too."

Not worth the wait,2023-03-15,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."
Epic meat lovers option,2025-05-06,4,"If you're a carnivore, their 'Butcher's Block' pizza is incredible. Five different meats, all high quality - the soppressata and house-made sausage are standouts. Just be ready for a food coma afterward!"

Overpriced for what you get,2025-04-26,3,"$24 for a medium pizza with just two toppings seems excessive. The ingredients were fresh and the crust was good, but nothing justified the premium price. There are better values elsewhere in town."
Masterclass in proper baking,2023-07-16,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."

Way too much oregano,2025-01-13,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
Perfect for watching sports,2024-04-11,4,"Great setup with TVs visible from every table, excellent pitcher specials during games, and their 'Game Day' pizza loaded with multiple meats and jalapeños is the perfect sports-watching food. Atmosphere gets lively but not obnoxious."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2025-04-05,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Disappointed with service,2023-07-24,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."

No flavor distinction,2024-02-13,3,Ordered two completely different specialty pizzas but they somehow tasted nearly identical. It's like they use the same base for everything and the toppings don't impart enough distinctive character.
Phenomenal crust,2024-07-14,5,"Whatever they do to their dough is magical - it's got that perfect combination of crispy and chewy with a slight sourdough tang. I could eat their plain crust by itself, it's that good."
Not worth the wait,2024-12-17,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."
Too much sauce,2023-10-27,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Pizza arrived upside-down,2023-04-08,1,Delivery driver must have taken a sharp turn because our pizza arrived completely flipped over in the box - all toppings stuck to the lid. Restaurant offered no solution other than suggesting we 'scrape it off and reassemble it.'
Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2023-09-20,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies. The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."
New owners ruined it,2024-01-23,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."

Not worth the wait,2024-08-18,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2025-02-10,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2023-09-22,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
Outstanding variety of options,2024-12-20,5,"Their menu has something for everyone - traditional options done well, creative specialties, and customizable choices. Even have dessert pizzas that are surprisingly good (try the Nutella and banana!)."

Tough leathery crust,2024-06-24,2,"The crust was so tough I almost couldn't bite through it - like trying to eat leather. The edges were particularly problematic, had to tear pieces off with significant effort. Completely lacks the pleasant chewiness good pizza should have."
Perfect for large parties,2023-11-19,5,"Their party package is fantastic - multiple 18-inch pizzas with varied toppings, plenty of sides, and they were accommodating with our group of 20. Everything arrived hot and on time, and they included all the necessary paper goods."

Excellence in simplicity,2023-09-10,5,"Their classic Margherita showcases their commitment to quality - the balance of sweet-acidic tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella, fragrant basil, and that perfectly chewy-crisp crust. Proof that simple can be sublime."
Incredible vodka sauce base,2023-07-28,5,"Their vodka sauce pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil is something special. The creamy, slightly spicy sauce is a perfect alternative to traditional tomato sauce. Add prosciutto for an extra flavor dimension!"
Too noisy for conversation,2024-05-06,3,The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option.
Overpriced for what you get,2023-06-24,3,"$24 for a medium pizza with just two toppings seems excessive. The ingredients were fresh and the crust was good, but nothing justified the premium price. There are better values elsewhere in town."
Outstanding variety of options,2025-03-06,5,"Their menu has something for everyone - traditional options done well, creative specialties, and customizable choices. Even have dessert pizzas that are surprisingly good (try the Nutella and banana!)."
Outstanding wood-fired perfection,2023-04-23,5,The wood-fired oven gives their pizza a distinctive smoky complexity you can't get any other way. The slight char adds bitterness that balances the sweetness of the sauce perfectly. Worth seeking out for this unique flavor profile.
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2023-09-27,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Phenomenal crust,2024-03-13,5,"Whatever they do to their dough is magical - it's got that perfect combination of crispy and chewy with a slight sourdough tang. I could eat their plain crust by itself, it's that good."
Underwhelming and basic,2025-01-07,3,"Nothing particularly wrong with it, but nothing memorable either. Standard crust, standard sauce, standard toppings. In a city with so many pizza options, this place doesn't give you any reason to return."
Too thin to be satisfying,2023-12-13,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Perfect buffalo mozzarella application,2023-09-23,5,They understand that buffalo mozzarella shouldn't be cooked too long or it loses its distinctive texture and flavor. Applied in dollops after the pizza is mostly baked so it just barely melts while maintaining its creamy integrity. Technical perfection!
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2025-04-10,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Best white pizza ever,2025-01-29,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2025-04-04,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
Perfect for picky eaters,2025-01-29,4,Their 'build your own quarter' option is genius - a large pizza divided into quadrants with different toppings. Perfect for our family where everyone wants something different. No more ordering multiple pizzas!
Stale-tasting crust,2024-08-29,2,"The crust had a stale, almost cardboard-like quality that suggests either old dough or old flour. Fresh ingredients on top couldn't compensate for the foundation being off."
Amazing Detroit-style,2023-09-04,5,"Their Detroit-style square pizza is incredible - crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior, and those corner pieces are to die for! The pepperoni cup and char perfectly. Worth the 30-minute wait."
Perfect textural contrast,2025-05-14,5,"The contrast between the crisp bottom, the tender interior crumb, the gooey cheese, and the slight resistance of the toppings creates a textural symphony. Each bite is interesting and satisfying in a different way."
Perfect crust-to-topping ratio,2023-11-25,5,"Some places overload toppings so the crust gets soggy, others are too sparse. This place gets it perfect - enough toppings to get some in every bite, but not so much that the structural integrity is compromised."
Excellent wine pairings,2025-01-27,5,"Their curated wine list is designed specifically to pair with their pizzas, and the staff is knowledgeable about suggesting the perfect match. The house red with their sausage pizza is a transcendent combination."
Excellent attention to cooking time,2024-04-13,5,They nail the cooking time perfectly - pulling the pizza from the oven at exactly the right moment when the cheese is fully melted and bubbling but not yet browned. Shows expertise and attention to detail.
No flavor distinction,2025-06-11,3,Ordered two completely different specialty pizzas but they somehow tasted nearly identical. It's like they use the same base for everything and the toppings don't impart enough distinctive character.
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2024-02-18,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2023-02-27,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."
Perfect thin crust,2023-08-09,5,"If you're a thin crust fan, this is your place. Cracker-thin, crispy all the way through, yet somehow still has a nice chew. Their simple cheese pizza showcases their excellent sauce - slightly sweet with a nice herb blend."
Perfect for dietary restrictions,2025-04-03,5,"As someone with multiple food allergies, I appreciate that they take dietary concerns seriously. Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"
Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2025-06-21,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
New owners ruined it,2023-08-14,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."
Pizza arrived upside-down,2024-06-28,1,Delivery driver must have taken a sharp turn because our pizza arrived completely flipped over in the box - all toppings stuck to the lid. Restaurant offered no solution other than suggesting we 'scrape it off and reassemble it.'
Perfect balance of flavors,2023-02-09,5,"Their 'Mediterranean' pizza has the perfect balance of flavors - the briny olives, tangy feta, fresh tomatoes, and herb-infused olive oil all complement each other without any one element overwhelming the others."
Perfect temperature every time,2023-04-02,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
Tasteless cheese substitute,2025-02-17,2,"Their vegan cheese option was terrible - had no meltability, a grainy texture, and tasted strongly of coconut which clashed with the tomato sauce. If you can't do vegan cheese well, better to offer cheese-free options that are properly balanced."
Rude staff ruined the meal,2023-03-29,2,"The pizza itself was decent, but the counter staff was incredibly rude - sighing when I asked questions about ingredients, rushing my order, and actually rolling their eyes when I requested extra napkins."
Too noisy for conversation,2023-09-13,3,The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option.
Perfect NY-style slices,2023-04-17,5,"As a transplant from NYC, I've been searching for authentic NY-style pizza. This place nails it - thin, foldable slices with the right amount of chew and grease. Their plain cheese slice is perfection."
Bland sauce needs work,2023-05-01,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2024-04-18,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
New owners ruined it,2025-02-20,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."
Incredible vodka sauce base,2023-06-02,5,"Their vodka sauce pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil is something special. The creamy, slightly spicy sauce is a perfect alternative to traditional tomato sauce. Add prosciutto for an extra flavor dimension!"
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2023-10-06,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
Perfect for lunch specials,2025-03-19,4,"Their lunch deal is unbeatable - $10 for a 10-inch pizza and small salad. The pizza comes out quickly, is always fresh, and the perfect size for one person. Great place for a work lunch."
Brilliant use of fermented dough,2024-11-23,5,Their 72-hour fermented dough has incredible depth of flavor with subtle sourdough notes. The extended fermentation creates a complex web of flavors and perfect texture that you simply can't achieve with quick-rise methods.
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2024-11-15,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."

Hidden gem for vegans,2023-06-11,5,"I can't believe how good their vegan pizza is! They make their own cashew cheese that actually melts properly, and their vegetable toppings are always fresh and seasonal. Even my non-vegan friends love it."
Perfect buffalo mozzarella application,2024-06-30,5,They understand that buffalo mozzarella shouldn't be cooked too long or it loses its distinctive texture and flavor. Applied in dollops after the pizza is mostly baked so it just barely melts while maintaining its creamy integrity. Technical perfection!
Magnificent flavor layering,2024-09-02,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Cold center burnt edges,2024-08-24,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Way too much crust,2024-06-28,2,The edge crust (cornicione) was comically large - almost half of each slice was just bread with no toppings. This ratio of crust to actual pizza was way off and made for a disappointing experience.
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2023-01-23,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."
Too much cheese,2024-12-08,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2025-03-22,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
False advertising on ingredients,2025-05-02,1,"Menu promised 'house-made Italian sausage' but what came on my pizza was clearly pre-formed, uniform pellets of commercial sausage. When questioned, staff admitted they don't make any ingredients in-house despite menu claims."
Doughy and undercooked,2025-06-29,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Tough leathery crust,2025-02-27,2,"The crust was so tough I almost couldn't bite through it - like trying to eat leather. The edges were particularly problematic, had to tear pieces off with significant effort. Completely lacks the pleasant chewiness good pizza should have."
Terrible delivery experience,2024-05-24,1,"Ordered for Valentine's Day and regretted it. Pizza took 2 hours to arrive, was cold, and had the wrong toppings. Called the restaurant and they seemed completely unconcerned. Never again."
Sauce like ketchup,2025-03-26,2,"The sauce was suspiciously sweet and one-dimensional, reminiscent of ketchup rather than a proper pizza sauce. No evidence of herbs, garlic, or any complexity. Ruined what otherwise could have been a decent pizza."
Absurdly small slices,2024-05-30,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."
Innovative toppings,2023-06-20,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."
Excellent Chicago deep dish,2023-06-22,5,"Hard to find authentic Chicago-style pizza in this area, but they nail it. The buttery, flaky crust, the layering of cheese under the sauce, the chunky tomato topping - all perfect. Worth the 45-minute cook time."
Burnt crust ruins it,2025-03-14,2,"They claim 'char' is part of the Neapolitan experience, but there's a difference between char and burnt. The entire bottom of my pizza was black and bitter. Scraping it off meant losing half the crust."
Best pizza in town,2025-01-09,5,"The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Their signature pepperoni pizza had the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, and the pepperoni curled up into little cups of deliciousness. Will definitely be back!"
Painfully obvious cheap ingredients,2024-07-02,2,"The pre-shredded cheese didn't melt properly, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the sausage had that distinctive processed flavor. At these prices, cutting corners on ingredients is inexcusable."
Perfect ingredient distribution,2023-11-27,5,"Every bite had the perfect combination of ingredients - no barren spots, no overwhelming clumps. The toppings were distributed with such precision it almost seemed measured. The mark of true professionals!"
Perfect for picky eaters,2023-03-15,4,Their 'build your own quarter' option is genius - a large pizza divided into quadrants with different toppings. Perfect for our family where everyone wants something different. No more ordering multiple pizzas!

Innovative flavor combinations,2024-10-15,5,"Their 'Avant Garde' menu section features combinations I would never have thought of but somehow work perfectly. The pear, gorgonzola, walnut, and honey pizza was a revelation of sweet, salty, and savory harmony."
Excellent customer service,2024-03-19,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
Doughy and undercooked,2023-11-14,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."

Righteous ranch drizzle,2024-03-24,5,Their house-made ranch drizzle takes their pizzas to another level. It's not your typical ranch - has hints of dill and garlic with a perfect consistency that adds creaminess without making things soggy.
Too much sauce,2024-09-03,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Way too much oregano,2023-06-08,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
Phenomenal crust,2023-10-22,5,"Whatever they do to their dough is magical - it's got that perfect combination of crispy and chewy with a slight sourdough tang. I could eat their plain crust by itself, it's that good."

Mediocre at best,2025-01-30,3,"Nothing terrible but nothing special either. The crust was okay, toppings were standard, and service was fine. It's the kind of place you go when you're in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip for."
Best white pizza ever,2023-11-30,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"

Best Hawaiian in the city,2023-06-26,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."
Perfect for big groups,2024-03-23,5,"We had a party of 12 and they accommodated us perfectly. Their 20-inch shareable pizzas are great for groups, and they were happy to do half-and-half toppings to please everyone. Service was impressively coordinated."

No-cheese option was all sauce,2024-11-13,2,"Ordered a cheese-free pizza for my dairy-allergic friend, but they made no adjustments - just removed the cheese and left a soggy sauce-covered bread. Good pizza without cheese requires rebalancing other elements."

Outstanding breakfast pizza,2023-11-13,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
Masterclass in proper baking,2024-12-05,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
Great gluten-free option,2024-05-15,4,"As someone with celiac disease, finding good gluten-free pizza is a challenge. Their cauliflower crust was one of the best I've had - doesn't fall apart and has a nice flavor. Toppings were generous too."
Epic meat lovers option,2024-07-10,4,"If you're a carnivore, their 'Butcher's Block' pizza is incredible. Five different meats, all high quality - the soppressata and house-made sausage are standouts. Just be ready for a food coma afterward!"

Skimpy on toppings,2025-04-20,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."

Mediocre at best,2023-11-16,3,"Nothing terrible but nothing special either. The crust was okay, toppings were standard, and service was fine. It's the kind of place you go when you're in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip for."
Refrigerated dough taste,2023-02-08,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."

Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"
Sloppy presentation,2025-05-10,3,"The pizza looked like it had been assembled in a hurry - toppings haphazardly thrown on, cheese unevenly distributed, and the cutting was so uneven that some slices were twice the size of others. Taste was okay, but appearance matters too."
Too much sauce,2023-11-07,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Too much garlic,2025-05-30,3,"I love garlic but this was excessive - felt like they mistook cloves for teaspoons in the recipe. My breath was lethal afterward, and the powerful flavor overwhelmed the other ingredients."
Perfect NY-style slices,2024-04-06,5,"As a transplant from NYC, I've been searching for authentic NY-style pizza. This place nails it - thin, foldable slices with the right amount of chew and grease. Their plain cheese slice is perfection."

Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2025-06-14,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies. The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."
Mediocre at best,2024-07-21,3,"Nothing terrible but nothing special either. The crust was okay, toppings were standard, and service was fine. It's the kind of place you go when you're in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip for."

Excellent for takeout,2023-12-01,4,"Their pizza travels remarkably well. Even after a 20-minute drive home, the crust was still crispy and everything was at the perfect temperature. They have their packaging technique down to a science."
Magnificent flavor layering,2024-10-10,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Outstanding breakfast pizza,2023-01-10,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
Magnificent flavor layering,2025-03-15,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Perfect for kids' parties,2025-05-31,5,"Hosted my son's birthday here and it was fantastic. They did a dough-tossing demonstration for the kids, let them make their own mini pizzas, and the staff was incredibly patient and kind."
Perfect ingredient distribution,2023-10-21,5,"Every bite had the perfect combination of ingredients - no barren spots, no overwhelming clumps. The toppings were distributed with such precision it almost seemed measured. The mark of true professionals!"
Excellent customer service,2025-03-26,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
Perfect for watching sports,2023-02-25,4,"Great setup with TVs visible from every table, excellent pitcher specials during games, and their 'Game Day' pizza loaded with multiple meats and jalapeños is the perfect sports-watching food. Atmosphere gets lively but not obnoxious."
Perfect crust-to-topping ratio,2025-03-31,5,"Some places overload toppings so the crust gets soggy, others are too sparse. This place gets it perfect - enough toppings to get some in every bite, but not so much that the structural integrity is compromised."
Tasteless cheese substitute,2025-05-01,2,"Their vegan cheese option was terrible - had no meltability, a grainy texture, and tasted strongly of coconut which clashed with the tomato sauce. If you can't do vegan cheese well, better to offer cheese-free options that are properly balanced."
Pizza arrived upside-down,2025-02-04,1,Delivery driver must have taken a sharp turn because our pizza arrived completely flipped over in the box - all toppings stuck to the lid. Restaurant offered no solution other than suggesting we 'scrape it off and reassemble it.'
Spicy special was too much,2023-09-03,2,Their 'Firebreather' pizza should come with a warning label. It wasn't enjoyably spicy - it was painfully hot to the point where I couldn't taste anything else. Had to throw most of it away.
Brilliant seasonal rotation,2023-12-26,5,"Love that they have a rotating seasonal pizza that showcases what's fresh. The current spring offering with asparagus, green garlic, and fresh peas is bright and delicious - a perfect reflection of the season."
Phenomenal crust,2025-03-23,5,"Whatever they do to their dough is magical - it's got that perfect combination of crispy and chewy with a slight sourdough tang. I could eat their plain crust by itself, it's that good."
Excellent Chicago deep dish,2024-01-04,5,"Hard to find authentic Chicago-style pizza in this area, but they nail it. The buttery, flaky crust, the layering of cheese under the sauce, the chunky tomato topping - all perfect. Worth the 45-minute cook time."
Excellence in simplicity,2024-08-12,5,"Their classic Margherita showcases their commitment to quality - the balance of sweet-acidic tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella, fragrant basil, and that perfectly chewy-crisp crust. Proof that simple can be sublime."
Excellent beer pairing suggestions,2024-09-27,5,"Not only is their pizza excellent (try the fig and prosciutto!), but the staff is knowledgeable about their craft beer selection and can suggest the perfect pairing for whatever pizza you order."
Perfect crunch factor,2023-04-02,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."
Excellent beer pairing suggestions,2023-10-20,5,"Not only is their pizza excellent (try the fig and prosciutto!), but the staff is knowledgeable about their craft beer selection and can suggest the perfect pairing for whatever pizza you order."
Perfect for large parties,2023-06-01,5,"Their party package is fantastic - multiple 18-inch pizzas with varied toppings, plenty of sides, and they were accommodating with our group of 20. Everything arrived hot and on time, and they included all the necessary paper goods."
Overpriced for what you get,2023-07-17,3,"$24 for a medium pizza with just two toppings seems excessive. The ingredients were fresh and the crust was good, but nothing justified the premium price. There are better values elsewhere in town."
Too noisy for conversation,2024-04-13,3,The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option.
Supreme quality control,2023-09-29,5,"Visited multiple times and the consistency is impressive - every pizza comes out identical to the last one, with the same excellent quality. Shows serious commitment to training and standards that's rare in casual dining."
Creative seasonal specials,2023-07-18,5,"Just had their spring special with asparagus, lemon ricotta, and prosciutto. The combination was bright, fresh, and perfect for the season. Love that they use local, seasonal ingredients."
Masterclass in proper baking,2023-03-07,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
Perfect ingredient distribution,2024-09-04,5,"Every bite had the perfect combination of ingredients - no barren spots, no overwhelming clumps. The toppings were distributed with such precision it almost seemed measured. The mark of true professionals!"
Too greasy to enjoy,2024-01-25,2,"Had to literally blot my pizza with napkins, which came away completely saturated with grease. Whatever flavor might have been there was drowned in oil. Couldn't finish it as it was making me feel ill."
Absurdly small slices,2025-03-06,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."

Fresh ingredients make the difference,2024-08-02,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
All style no substance,2024-07-02,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."
Late night savior,2023-04-06,4,"Open until 2am on weekends, this place has saved me many times after a night out. Their slices are huge, reheated perfectly crisp, and they have creative toppings that hit the spot when you're hungry late at night."
Bland sauce needs work,2023-11-04,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
Supreme quality control,2023-11-22,5,"Visited multiple times and the consistency is impressive - every pizza comes out identical to the last one, with the same excellent quality. Shows serious commitment to training and standards that's rare in casual dining."
No-cheese option was all sauce,2024-07-06,2,"Ordered a cheese-free pizza for my dairy-allergic friend, but they made no adjustments - just removed the cheese and left a soggy sauce-covered bread. Good pizza without cheese requires rebalancing other elements."

Toppings slide right off,2023-01-25,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Perfect textural contrast,2025-01-01,5,"The contrast between the crisp bottom, the tender interior crumb, the gooey cheese, and the slight resistance of the toppings creates a textural symphony. Each bite is interesting and satisfying in a different way."
Brilliant seasonal rotation,2023-06-18,5,"Love that they have a rotating seasonal pizza that showcases what's fresh. The current spring offering with asparagus, green garlic, and fresh peas is bright and delicious - a perfect reflection of the season."
Bland sauce needs work,2023-11-17,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2023-03-24,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Perfect for lunch specials,2025-02-15,4,"Their lunch deal is unbeatable - $10 for a 10-inch pizza and small salad. The pizza comes out quickly, is always fresh, and the perfect size for one person. Great place for a work lunch."
Best Hawaiian in the city,2023-02-03,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."
Too much sauce,2023-03-27,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Exceptional sauce-making technique,2025-04-10,5,"You can tell their sauce is made with properly hand-crushed tomatoes - it has that perfect texture with small chunks rather than being completely smooth. The bright flavor suggests minimal cooking, allowing the tomato quality to shine."
Perfectly crispy crust,2025-03-22,5,"However they achieve it, their crust has the perfect crispness all the way through - no soggy middle! Even the slices with lots of toppings maintain their structural integrity. Engineering marvel of pizza."
Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2025-05-11,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies. The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."
Crispy yet chewy perfection,2023-10-15,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."
Terrible delivery experience,2024-10-08,1,"Ordered for Valentine's Day and regretted it. Pizza took 2 hours to arrive, was cold, and had the wrong toppings. Called the restaurant and they seemed completely unconcerned. Never again."
Excellent beer pairing suggestions,2023-12-25,5,"Not only is their pizza excellent (try the fig and prosciutto!), but the staff is knowledgeable about their craft beer selection and can suggest the perfect pairing for whatever pizza you order."
Perfect buffalo mozzarella application,2024-12-25,5,They understand that buffalo mozzarella shouldn't be cooked too long or it loses its distinctive texture and flavor. Applied in dollops after the pizza is mostly baked so it just barely melts while maintaining its creamy integrity. Technical perfection!
All style no substance,2023-03-13,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2025-01-25,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
Perfect balance of flavors,2024-03-27,5,"Their 'Mediterranean' pizza has the perfect balance of flavors - the briny olives, tangy feta, fresh tomatoes, and herb-infused olive oil all complement each other without any one element overwhelming the others."
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2023-12-30,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."
Absurdly small slices,2023-02-17,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."
Way too much crust,2023-10-02,2,The edge crust (cornicione) was comically large - almost half of each slice was just bread with no toppings. This ratio of crust to actual pizza was way off and made for a disappointing experience.
Excellent attention to cooking time,2023-07-05,5,They nail the cooking time perfectly - pulling the pizza from the oven at exactly the right moment when the cheese is fully melted and bubbling but not yet browned. Shows expertise and attention to detail.
Excellent attention to cooking time,2024-07-16,5,They nail the cooking time perfectly - pulling the pizza from the oven at exactly the right moment when the cheese is fully melted and bubbling but not yet browned. Shows expertise and attention to detail.
Sloppy presentation,2024-05-08,3,"The pizza looked like it had been assembled in a hurry - toppings haphazardly thrown on, cheese unevenly distributed, and the cutting was so uneven that some slices were twice the size of others. Taste was okay, but appearance matters too."
Toppings slide right off,2024-01-21,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Too expensive for pizza,2023-06-16,3,"The pizza is good, I'll give them that. But $30 for a basic large cheese pizza is highway robbery. Add toppings and you're looking at $40-50. The quality doesn't justify these premium prices."
Perfect for lunch specials,2023-11-12,4,"Their lunch deal is unbeatable - $10 for a 10-inch pizza and small salad. The pizza comes out quickly, is always fresh, and the perfect size for one person. Great place for a work lunch."
Brilliant use of fermented dough,2024-08-06,5,Their 72-hour fermented dough has incredible depth of flavor with subtle sourdough notes. The extended fermentation creates a complex web of flavors and perfect texture that you simply can't achieve with quick-rise methods.
Underwhelming and basic,2023-10-29,3,"Nothing particularly wrong with it, but nothing memorable either. Standard crust, standard sauce, standard toppings. In a city with so many pizza options, this place doesn't give you any reason to return."
Innovative flavor combinations,2023-07-17,5,"Their 'Avant Garde' menu section features combinations I would never have thought of but somehow work perfectly. The pear, gorgonzola, walnut, and honey pizza was a revelation of sweet, salty, and savory harmony."
Too much emphasis on appearance,2023-09-20,3,"The pizza was clearly designed to look good in photos - perfect symmetry, vibrant colors, photogenic cheese pull - but the flavor was underwhelming. Style over substance for the Instagram crowd."
Exceptional spinach ricotta pie,2024-08-30,5,Their white pizza with spinach and ricotta is exceptional - the creamy richness of the cheese balanced by the slight bitterness of the greens. The garlic-infused olive oil base ties everything together perfectly.
Too much cornmeal,2023-07-24,3,"They use cornmeal on the bottom of the crust to prevent sticking, which is standard, but they use so much that it's like eating pizza on a sandpaper surface. Gritty texture overwhelms the experience."
Brilliant use of fermented dough,2023-05-11,5,Their 72-hour fermented dough has incredible depth of flavor with subtle sourdough notes. The extended fermentation creates a complex web of flavors and perfect texture that you simply can't achieve with quick-rise methods.
Way too much oregano,2025-06-18,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
Perfect textural contrast,2024-07-14,5,"The contrast between the crisp bottom, the tender interior crumb, the gooey cheese, and the slight resistance of the toppings creates a textural symphony. Each bite is interesting and satisfying in a different way."
Undercooked in the middle,2024-12-11,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2024-04-04,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Excellence in simplicity,2024-06-04,5,"Their classic Margherita showcases their commitment to quality - the balance of sweet-acidic tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella, fragrant basil, and that perfectly chewy-crisp crust. Proof that simple can be sublime."
Doughy and undercooked,2023-06-02,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Doughy and undercooked,2024-08-09,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Burned mouth on first bite,2024-04-19,2,"They served the pizza dangerously hot - barely out of the oven with no time to cool. Severely burned the roof of my mouth on the first bite, which ruined the rest of the meal and my next few days."
Excellent Chicago deep dish,2024-04-21,5,"Hard to find authentic Chicago-style pizza in this area, but they nail it. The buttery, flaky crust, the layering of cheese under the sauce, the chunky tomato topping - all perfect. Worth the 45-minute cook time."
Spicy special was too much,2023-07-13,2,Their 'Firebreather' pizza should come with a warning label. It wasn't enjoyably spicy - it was painfully hot to the point where I couldn't taste anything else. Had to throw most of it away.
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2023-02-17,5,They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!
Excellent wine pairings,2023-09-13,5,"Their curated wine list is designed specifically to pair with their pizzas, and the staff is knowledgeable about suggesting the perfect match. The house red with their sausage pizza is a transcendent combination."
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2024-01-27,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
Tough leathery crust,2023-09-02,2,"The crust was so tough I almost couldn't bite through it - like trying to eat leather. The edges were particularly problematic, had to tear pieces off with significant effort. Completely lacks the pleasant chewiness good pizza should have."
Not worth the wait,2023-07-17,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."
Way too much oregano,2025-04-15,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
Overpriced for what you get,2024-08-26,3,"$24 for a medium pizza with just two toppings seems excessive. The ingredients were fresh and the crust was good, but nothing justified the premium price. There are better values elsewhere in town."
Amazing Detroit-style,2024-09-09,5,"Their Detroit-style square pizza is incredible - crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior, and those corner pieces are to die for! The pepperoni cup and char perfectly. Worth the 30-minute wait."
Greasy and disappointing,2024-03-16,2,"I had high hopes based on the reviews, but my pizza was swimming in grease. The crust was undercooked in the center, and the promised 'fresh vegetables' looked and tasted canned. Such a letdown."
Unmelted cheese in the center,2023-12-30,2,"The edges were fine but the center had cold, unmelted cheese - a sign the oven wasn't hot enough or the pizza wasn't cooked long enough. Basic pizza fundamentals seem to be lacking."
Pizza arrived upside-down,2025-02-04,1,Delivery driver must have taken a sharp turn because our pizza arrived completely flipped over in the box - all toppings stuck to the lid. Restaurant offered no solution other than suggesting we 'scrape it off and reassemble it.'

Way too much oregano,2024-12-19,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
Masterful use of olive oil,2024-05-12,5,"The drizzle of high-quality olive oil they add just before serving makes all the difference - adds richness, enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, and adds a wonderful aromatic element. Simple but transformative."
Righteous ranch drizzle,2023-07-20,5,Their house-made ranch drizzle takes their pizzas to another level. It's not your typical ranch - has hints of dill and garlic with a perfect consistency that adds creaminess without making things soggy.
Too noisy for conversation,2023-03-30,3,The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option.
Perfect thin crust,2024-09-26,5,"If you're a thin crust fan, this is your place. Cracker-thin, crispy all the way through, yet somehow still has a nice chew. Their simple cheese pizza showcases their excellent sauce - slightly sweet with a nice herb blend."
Brilliant use of fermented dough,2023-09-20,5,Their 72-hour fermented dough has incredible depth of flavor with subtle sourdough notes. The extended fermentation creates a complex web of flavors and perfect texture that you simply can't achieve with quick-rise methods.
New owners ruined it,2023-09-26,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."
Crispy yet chewy perfection,2025-05-09,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."
Doughy and undercooked,2025-04-23,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."

Weird aftertaste,2024-03-02,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."
Best Hawaiian in the city,2023-08-19,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."
Too much emphasis on appearance,2023-07-17,3,"The pizza was clearly designed to look good in photos - perfect symmetry, vibrant colors, photogenic cheese pull - but the flavor was underwhelming. Style over substance for the Instagram crowd."
Not worth the wait,2023-03-21,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."
Rude staff ruined the meal,2025-06-24,2,"The pizza itself was decent, but the counter staff was incredibly rude - sighing when I asked questions about ingredients, rushing my order, and actually rolling their eyes when I requested extra napkins."
Masterclass in proper baking,2025-01-20,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
Epic meat lovers option,2024-01-20,4,"If you're a carnivore, their 'Butcher's Block' pizza is incredible. Five different meats, all high quality - the soppressata and house-made sausage are standouts. Just be ready for a food coma afterward!"
Perfect buffalo mozzarella application,2024-06-09,5,They understand that buffalo mozzarella shouldn't be cooked too long or it loses its distinctive texture and flavor. Applied in dollops after the pizza is mostly baked so it just barely melts while maintaining its creamy integrity. Technical perfection!
Perfect for lunch specials,2023-11-15,4,"Their lunch deal is unbeatable - $10 for a 10-inch pizza and small salad. The pizza comes out quickly, is always fresh, and the perfect size for one person. Great place for a work lunch."
Crust like cardboard,2023-06-22,2,"The crust had all the flavor and texture of packing material - dry, tough, and completely devoid of character. Even the decent toppings couldn't save it. The foundation of good pizza is good dough, and this wasn't it."
Perfect crunch factor,2025-06-22,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."
No flavor distinction,2023-12-05,3,Ordered two completely different specialty pizzas but they somehow tasted nearly identical. It's like they use the same base for everything and the toppings don't impart enough distinctive character.
Undercooked in the middle,2024-11-27,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."
Perfect thin crust,2024-11-13,5,"If you're a thin crust fan, this is your place. Cracker-thin, crispy all the way through, yet somehow still has a nice chew. Their simple cheese pizza showcases their excellent sauce - slightly sweet with a nice herb blend."
Ideal char-to-chew ratio,2024-07-23,5,The small charred bubbles on the crust add amazing flavor without dominating. They've mastered that balance between the slight bitterness of char and the natural sweetness of the dough. Technical perfection!
Too salty,2023-06-26,2,"Everything I tried was oversalted - the crust, the sauce, and especially the cheese. It was like they were trying to ensure you'd order more drinks. Couldn't finish my pizza and was thirsty all night."
Authentic Italian experience,2023-01-07,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
Excellent customer service,2023-01-25,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
Ideal char-to-chew ratio,2023-07-20,5,The small charred bubbles on the crust add amazing flavor without dominating. They've mastered that balance between the slight bitterness of char and the natural sweetness of the dough. Technical perfection!
Sauce like ketchup,2024-11-27,2,"The sauce was suspiciously sweet and one-dimensional, reminiscent of ketchup rather than a proper pizza sauce. No evidence of herbs, garlic, or any complexity. Ruined what otherwise could have been a decent pizza."
Masterclass in proper baking,2024-03-15,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
Too much salt in the dough,2024-01-26,2,The crust was so salty it was almost inedible - overwhelmed all the other flavors and left me incredibly thirsty afterward. A heavy hand with salt ruined what could have been a good pizza.
Brilliant seasonal rotation,2024-05-18,5,"Love that they have a rotating seasonal pizza that showcases what's fresh. The current spring offering with asparagus, green garlic, and fresh peas is bright and delicious - a perfect reflection of the season."
Excellent for takeout,2025-05-15,4,"Their pizza travels remarkably well. Even after a 20-minute drive home, the crust was still crispy and everything was at the perfect temperature. They have their packaging technique down to a science."
Amazing Detroit-style,2024-05-08,5,"Their Detroit-style square pizza is incredible - crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior, and those corner pieces are to die for! The pepperoni cup and char perfectly. Worth the 30-minute wait."
False advertising on size,2024-07-26,2,"Their menu clearly states that a large pizza is 16 inches, but what we received couldn't have been more than 14 inches. When questioned, they claimed their menu was outdated but refused any adjustment."
Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2024-01-17,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
Expert-level pizza folding,2024-04-13,5,Their thin-crust slices fold perfectly New York-style without cracking or losing toppings. The slight resistance before the fold is exactly what you want - showing the perfect balance of crisp and chew.
Too thin to be satisfying,2024-12-20,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2024-04-20,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Best pizza in town,2023-03-29,5,"The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Their signature pepperoni pizza had the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, and the pepperoni curled up into little cups of deliciousness. Will definitely be back!"
Perfect for big groups,2024-06-20,5,"We had a party of 12 and they accommodated us perfectly. Their 20-inch shareable pizzas are great for groups, and they were happy to do half-and-half toppings to please everyone. Service was impressively coordinated."
Superior ingredients make the difference,2023-12-25,5,"They import their flour from Italy, use San Marzano tomatoes, and make their mozzarella in-house daily. The commitment to quality ingredients is evident in every bite - nothing is an afterthought."
Excellence in simplicity,2025-03-20,5,"Their classic Margherita showcases their commitment to quality - the balance of sweet-acidic tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella, fragrant basil, and that perfectly chewy-crisp crust. Proof that simple can be sublime."
Perfect NY-style slices,2025-04-16,5,"As a transplant from NYC, I've been searching for authentic NY-style pizza. This place nails it - thin, foldable slices with the right amount of chew and grease. Their plain cheese slice is perfection."
Amazing Detroit-style,2024-03-23,5,"Their Detroit-style square pizza is incredible - crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior, and those corner pieces are to die for! The pepperoni cup and char perfectly. Worth the 30-minute wait."
Innovative toppings,2024-08-02,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."
Authentic coal-fired perfection,2024-05-20,5,Their coal-fired oven gives the pizza a distinctive char and smoky flavor that's impossible to replicate any other way. The slight bitterness of the charred spots perfectly balances the sweetness of the sauce.
Too much sauce,2023-10-26,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2023-09-30,5,They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!
Not worth the wait,2024-09-13,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."
Skimpy on toppings,2024-06-20,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."
Creative seasonal specials,2025-05-29,5,"Just had their spring special with asparagus, lemon ricotta, and prosciutto. The combination was bright, fresh, and perfect for the season. Love that they use local, seasonal ingredients."
Underwhelming and basic,2025-06-22,3,"Nothing particularly wrong with it, but nothing memorable either. Standard crust, standard sauce, standard toppings. In a city with so many pizza options, this place doesn't give you any reason to return."
Late night savior,2024-10-01,4,"Open until 2am on weekends, this place has saved me many times after a night out. Their slices are huge, reheated perfectly crisp, and they have creative toppings that hit the spot when you're hungry late at night."
Crust like cardboard,2025-02-05,2,"The crust had all the flavor and texture of packing material - dry, tough, and completely devoid of character. Even the decent toppings couldn't save it. The foundation of good pizza is good dough, and this wasn't it."
Outstanding wood-fired perfection,2025-02-10,5,The wood-fired oven gives their pizza a distinctive smoky complexity you can't get any other way. The slight char adds bitterness that balances the sweetness of the sauce perfectly. Worth seeking out for this unique flavor profile.
Too much sauce,2024-05-31,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
No-cheese option was all sauce,2023-02-25,2,"Ordered a cheese-free pizza for my dairy-allergic friend, but they made no adjustments - just removed the cheese and left a soggy sauce-covered bread. Good pizza without cheese requires rebalancing other elements."
False advertising on size,2023-03-02,2,"Their menu clearly states that a large pizza is 16 inches, but what we received couldn't have been more than 14 inches. When questioned, they claimed their menu was outdated but refused any adjustment."
Perfect for late-night cravings,2023-12-27,5,"Open until 3am on weekends, this place has saved many late nights. The slices are huge, they reheat them perfectly so they're crispy, and their special late-night menu items are creative and delicious."
Crust like cardboard,2023-01-01,2,"The crust had all the flavor and texture of packing material - dry, tough, and completely devoid of character. Even the decent toppings couldn't save it. The foundation of good pizza is good dough, and this wasn't it."
Absurdly small slices,2023-07-02,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."
Cold center burnt edges,2024-02-14,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Sauce like ketchup,2023-05-07,2,"The sauce was suspiciously sweet and one-dimensional, reminiscent of ketchup rather than a proper pizza sauce. No evidence of herbs, garlic, or any complexity. Ruined what otherwise could have been a decent pizza."
Cheese solidified too quickly,2023-02-07,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Too expensive for pizza,2025-03-11,3,"The pizza is good, I'll give them that. But $30 for a basic large cheese pizza is highway robbery. Add toppings and you're looking at $40-50. The quality doesn't justify these premium prices."
Sloppy presentation,2023-11-12,3,"The pizza looked like it had been assembled in a hurry - toppings haphazardly thrown on, cheese unevenly distributed, and the cutting was so uneven that some slices were twice the size of others. Taste was okay, but appearance matters too."
Perfect textural contrast,2024-11-17,5,"The contrast between the crisp bottom, the tender interior crumb, the gooey cheese, and the slight resistance of the toppings creates a textural symphony. Each bite is interesting and satisfying in a different way."
Innovative flavor combinations,2023-01-23,5,"Their 'Avant Garde' menu section features combinations I would never have thought of but somehow work perfectly. The pear, gorgonzola, walnut, and honey pizza was a revelation of sweet, salty, and savory harmony."
Way too much crust,2024-05-13,2,The edge crust (cornicione) was comically large - almost half of each slice was just bread with no toppings. This ratio of crust to actual pizza was way off and made for a disappointing experience.
Too much sauce,2025-04-27,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Incredible vodka sauce base,2024-04-21,5,"Their vodka sauce pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil is something special. The creamy, slightly spicy sauce is a perfect alternative to traditional tomato sauce. Add prosciutto for an extra flavor dimension!"
Excellent beer pairing suggestions,2023-12-30,5,"Not only is their pizza excellent (try the fig and prosciutto!), but the staff is knowledgeable about their craft beer selection and can suggest the perfect pairing for whatever pizza you order."
Too greasy to enjoy,2024-10-22,2,"Had to literally blot my pizza with napkins, which came away completely saturated with grease. Whatever flavor might have been there was drowned in oil. Couldn't finish it as it was making me feel ill."
Too much sauce,2023-09-26,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Tomato sauce tasted rancid,2023-09-08,1,"The sauce had a distinctly off flavor that suggested the tomatoes had gone bad before processing. After two bites, couldn't continue eating as the rancid notes became more pronounced. Basic food safety seems questionable."
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2024-07-01,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2025-06-20,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies. The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."
Pizza arrived upside-down,2025-05-18,1,Delivery driver must have taken a sharp turn because our pizza arrived completely flipped over in the box - all toppings stuck to the lid. Restaurant offered no solution other than suggesting we 'scrape it off and reassemble it.'
Authentic Italian experience,2024-09-29,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
False advertising on ingredients,2024-06-05,1,"Menu promised 'house-made Italian sausage' but what came on my pizza was clearly pre-formed, uniform pellets of commercial sausage. When questioned, staff admitted they don't make any ingredients in-house despite menu claims."
Toppings slide right off,2023-02-11,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Amazing Detroit-style,2024-09-23,5,"Their Detroit-style square pizza is incredible - crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior, and those corner pieces are to die for! The pepperoni cup and char perfectly. Worth the 30-minute wait."
Bland sauce needs work,2024-01-09,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
Cheese solidified too quickly,2024-12-11,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Cold center burnt edges,2024-10-22,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Inconsistent quality,2023-12-09,3,I've been here three times. First visit: amazing. Second: terrible. Third: just okay. Seems like it really depends on who's working that day. Wish they could maintain better quality control.
Incredible vodka sauce base,2023-03-15,5,"Their vodka sauce pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil is something special. The creamy, slightly spicy sauce is a perfect alternative to traditional tomato sauce. Add prosciutto for an extra flavor dimension!"
Sloppy presentation,2023-03-09,3,"The pizza looked like it had been assembled in a hurry - toppings haphazardly thrown on, cheese unevenly distributed, and the cutting was so uneven that some slices were twice the size of others. Taste was okay, but appearance matters too."
Outstanding variety of options,2023-02-15,5,"Their menu has something for everyone - traditional options done well, creative specialties, and customizable choices. Even have dessert pizzas that are surprisingly good (try the Nutella and banana!)."
Cold center burnt edges,2024-04-06,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Weird aftertaste,2024-11-27,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."
Disappointed with service,2025-05-08,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."
Righteous ranch drizzle,2023-01-20,5,Their house-made ranch drizzle takes their pizzas to another level. It's not your typical ranch - has hints of dill and garlic with a perfect consistency that adds creaminess without making things soggy.
Excessive grease pooling,2024-03-25,2,"Had to continuously blot the pizza with napkins as pools of orange grease formed on top of the cheese with every passing minute. By the end, the napkins were completely saturated and transparent. Felt unhealthy even by pizza standards."
Perfect pepperoni placement,2023-12-18,5,"As a pepperoni perfectionist, I appreciate that they space the pepperoni so every bite gets one full piece. No bare spots or clumped areas. Shows attention to detail that elevates the whole experience."
Undercooked in the middle,2023-11-09,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."
Perfect buffalo mozzarella application,2025-02-21,5,They understand that buffalo mozzarella shouldn't be cooked too long or it loses its distinctive texture and flavor. Applied in dollops after the pizza is mostly baked so it just barely melts while maintaining its creamy integrity. Technical perfection!
Perfect NY-style slices,2024-07-04,5,"As a transplant from NYC, I've been searching for authentic NY-style pizza. This place nails it - thin, foldable slices with the right amount of chew and grease. Their plain cheese slice is perfection."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2024-03-23,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Skimpy on toppings,2025-02-07,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."
Weird aftertaste,2024-02-03,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."
Perfect textural contrast,2024-11-24,5,"The contrast between the crisp bottom, the tender interior crumb, the gooey cheese, and the slight resistance of the toppings creates a textural symphony. Each bite is interesting and satisfying in a different way."
Pizza barely survived the drive home,2025-02-24,2,"Ordered takeout and by the time I got home (15 minutes), the pizza was a soggy mess. They clearly don't use appropriate packaging for takeout - no vents to release steam means the crust steams itself into sogginess."
Cheese solidified too quickly,2024-02-09,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Unmelted cheese in the center,2023-03-02,2,"The edges were fine but the center had cold, unmelted cheese - a sign the oven wasn't hot enough or the pizza wasn't cooked long enough. Basic pizza fundamentals seem to be lacking."
Best pizza in town,2023-11-14,5,"The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Their signature pepperoni pizza had the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, and the pepperoni curled up into little cups of deliciousness. Will definitely be back!"

Best white pizza ever,2024-05-10,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"
Way too much oregano,2024-05-26,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2023-03-14,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Phenomenal crust,2024-11-20,5,"Whatever they do to their dough is magical - it's got that perfect combination of crispy and chewy with a slight sourdough tang. I could eat their plain crust by itself, it's that good."
Perfect pepperoni placement,2025-03-16,5,"As a pepperoni perfectionist, I appreciate that they space the pepperoni so every bite gets one full piece. No bare spots or clumped areas. Shows attention to detail that elevates the whole experience."

False advertising on size,2024-12-01,2,"Their menu clearly states that a large pizza is 16 inches, but what we received couldn't have been more than 14 inches. When questioned, they claimed their menu was outdated but refused any adjustment."
Too much salt in the dough,2025-02-04,2,The crust was so salty it was almost inedible - overwhelmed all the other flavors and left me incredibly thirsty afterward. A heavy hand with salt ruined what could have been a good pizza.
Perfect thin crust,2023-11-16,5,"If you're a thin crust fan, this is your place. Cracker-thin, crispy all the way through, yet somehow still has a nice chew. Their simple cheese pizza showcases their excellent sauce - slightly sweet with a nice herb blend."

Mediocre at best,2024-09-30,3,"Nothing terrible but nothing special either. The crust was okay, toppings were standard, and service was fine. It's the kind of place you go when you're in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip for."
Masterclass in proper baking,2024-04-27,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."

New owners ruined it,2023-07-17,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."
Late night savior,2024-03-26,4,"Open until 2am on weekends, this place has saved me many times after a night out. Their slices are huge, reheated perfectly crisp, and they have creative toppings that hit the spot when you're hungry late at night."

Rude staff ruined the meal,2025-02-06,2,"The pizza itself was decent, but the counter staff was incredibly rude - sighing when I asked questions about ingredients, rushing my order, and actually rolling their eyes when I requested extra napkins."
Ideal char-to-chew ratio,2023-10-12,5,The small charred bubbles on the crust add amazing flavor without dominating. They've mastered that balance between the slight bitterness of char and the natural sweetness of the dough. Technical perfection!
Tough leathery crust,2024-04-30,2,"The crust was so tough I almost couldn't bite through it - like trying to eat leather. The edges were particularly problematic, had to tear pieces off with significant effort. Completely lacks the pleasant chewiness good pizza should have."
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2025-01-12,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
Best Hawaiian in the city,2024-03-23,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."

Excellent for takeout,2023-10-26,4,"Their pizza travels remarkably well. Even after a 20-minute drive home, the crust was still crispy and everything was at the perfect temperature. They have their packaging technique down to a science."
Perfect temperature every time,2023-02-24,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
Tough leathery crust,2024-04-30,2,"The crust was so tough I almost couldn't bite through it - like trying to eat leather. The edges were particularly problematic, had to tear pieces off with significant effort. Completely lacks the pleasant chewiness good pizza should have."
Excellent wine pairings,2025-01-15,5,"Their curated wine list is designed specifically to pair with their pizzas, and the staff is knowledgeable about suggesting the perfect match. The house red with their sausage pizza is a transcendent combination."

Too much cornmeal,2024-09-24,3,"They use cornmeal on the bottom of the crust to prevent sticking, which is standard, but they use so much that it's like eating pizza on a sandpaper surface. Gritty texture overwhelms the experience."
Family night favorite,2023-04-07,5,"We bring our kids here every Friday night. The staff always make them feel special, providing dough for them to play with while we wait. Their kid-sized pizzas are perfect, and the parents love the craft beer selection."

Perfect for kids' parties,2024-07-18,5,"Hosted my son's birthday here and it was fantastic. They did a dough-tossing demonstration for the kids, let them make their own mini pizzas, and the staff was incredibly patient and kind."
Too expensive for pizza,2023-11-19,3,"The pizza is good, I'll give them that. But $30 for a basic large cheese pizza is highway robbery. Add toppings and you're looking at $40-50. The quality doesn't justify these premium prices."

Pizza barely survived the drive home,2023-08-23,2,"Ordered takeout and by the time I got home (15 minutes), the pizza was a soggy mess. They clearly don't use appropriate packaging for takeout - no vents to release steam means the crust steams itself into sogginess."
Best Hawaiian in the city,2023-07-22,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."
Spicy special was too much,2024-01-30,2,Their 'Firebreather' pizza should come with a warning label. It wasn't enjoyably spicy - it was painfully hot to the point where I couldn't taste anything else. Had to throw most of it away.
Greasy and disappointing,2024-06-13,2,"I had high hopes based on the reviews, but my pizza was swimming in grease. The crust was undercooked in the center, and the promised 'fresh vegetables' looked and tasted canned. Such a letdown."
Perfect for picky eaters,2024-09-12,4,Their 'build your own quarter' option is genius - a large pizza divided into quadrants with different toppings. Perfect for our family where everyone wants something different. No more ordering multiple pizzas!
Cold center burnt edges,2024-07-24,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Too much sauce,2025-02-28,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Underwhelming and basic,2023-08-23,3,"Nothing particularly wrong with it, but nothing memorable either. Standard crust, standard sauce, standard toppings. In a city with so many pizza options, this place doesn't give you any reason to return."
Innovative toppings,2024-05-30,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."
Burned bottom raw top,2023-08-07,1,The bottom of the crust was completely black while the cheese on top wasn't fully melted. This temperature imbalance suggests serious issues with their oven management and pizza-making technique.
Tiny portion sizes,2023-09-12,2,"Their 'personal' pizza is the size of a CD. For $15, I expected something that would actually satisfy my hunger. Had to order a second one, turning a quick lunch into an expensive disappointment."
Righteous ranch drizzle,2025-04-20,5,Their house-made ranch drizzle takes their pizzas to another level. It's not your typical ranch - has hints of dill and garlic with a perfect consistency that adds creaminess without making things soggy.
Amazing Detroit-style,2023-01-14,5,"Their Detroit-style square pizza is incredible - crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior, and those corner pieces are to die for! The pepperoni cup and char perfectly. Worth the 30-minute wait."
Sauce like ketchup,2023-07-25,2,"The sauce was suspiciously sweet and one-dimensional, reminiscent of ketchup rather than a proper pizza sauce. No evidence of herbs, garlic, or any complexity. Ruined what otherwise could have been a decent pizza."
Brilliant seasonal rotation,2023-11-01,5,"Love that they have a rotating seasonal pizza that showcases what's fresh. The current spring offering with asparagus, green garlic, and fresh peas is bright and delicious - a perfect reflection of the season."
Toppings slide right off,2024-05-30,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Dirty restaurant,2023-10-18,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."
Too much garlic,2025-01-13,3,"I love garlic but this was excessive - felt like they mistook cloves for teaspoons in the recipe. My breath was lethal afterward, and the powerful flavor overwhelmed the other ingredients."
Skimpy on toppings,2024-07-18,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."
Family night favorite,2025-02-24,5,"We bring our kids here every Friday night. The staff always make them feel special, providing dough for them to play with while we wait. Their kid-sized pizzas are perfect, and the parents love the craft beer selection."
Great gluten-free option,2024-11-27,4,"As someone with celiac disease, finding good gluten-free pizza is a challenge. Their cauliflower crust was one of the best I've had - doesn't fall apart and has a nice flavor. Toppings were generous too."
Perfect for large parties,2024-12-11,5,"Their party package is fantastic - multiple 18-inch pizzas with varied toppings, plenty of sides, and they were accommodating with our group of 20. Everything arrived hot and on time, and they included all the necessary paper goods."
Undercooked in the middle,2024-09-17,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."
Doughy and undercooked,2024-10-16,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Perfect ingredient distribution,2024-02-26,5,"Every bite had the perfect combination of ingredients - no barren spots, no overwhelming clumps. The toppings were distributed with such precision it almost seemed measured. The mark of true professionals!"
Brilliant seasonal rotation,2024-07-19,5,"Love that they have a rotating seasonal pizza that showcases what's fresh. The current spring offering with asparagus, green garlic, and fresh peas is bright and delicious - a perfect reflection of the season."
Perfect for lunch specials,2023-05-24,4,"Their lunch deal is unbeatable - $10 for a 10-inch pizza and small salad. The pizza comes out quickly, is always fresh, and the perfect size for one person. Great place for a work lunch."
Brilliant seasonal rotation,2024-01-09,5,"Love that they have a rotating seasonal pizza that showcases what's fresh. The current spring offering with asparagus, green garlic, and fresh peas is bright and delicious - a perfect reflection of the season."
Tasteless cheese substitute,2023-05-21,2,"Their vegan cheese option was terrible - had no meltability, a grainy texture, and tasted strongly of coconut which clashed with the tomato sauce. If you can't do vegan cheese well, better to offer cheese-free options that are properly balanced."
Epic meat lovers option,2023-05-04,4,"If you're a carnivore, their 'Butcher's Block' pizza is incredible. Five different meats, all high quality - the soppressata and house-made sausage are standouts. Just be ready for a food coma afterward!"
Bland sauce needs work,2023-11-18,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
Burnt crust ruins it,2024-09-15,2,"They claim 'char' is part of the Neapolitan experience, but there's a difference between char and burnt. The entire bottom of my pizza was black and bitter. Scraping it off meant losing half the crust."
Too much cheese,2025-05-07,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Toppings slide right off,2024-09-14,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Way too much crust,2023-02-11,2,The edge crust (cornicione) was comically large - almost half of each slice was just bread with no toppings. This ratio of crust to actual pizza was way off and made for a disappointing experience.
Way too much oregano,2024-02-02,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
Tiny portion sizes,2025-02-05,2,"Their 'personal' pizza is the size of a CD. For $15, I expected something that would actually satisfy my hunger. Had to order a second one, turning a quick lunch into an expensive disappointment."
Tasteless cheese substitute,2023-03-25,2,"Their vegan cheese option was terrible - had no meltability, a grainy texture, and tasted strongly of coconut which clashed with the tomato sauce. If you can't do vegan cheese well, better to offer cheese-free options that are properly balanced."
Dirty restaurant,2024-05-30,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."
Pizza arrived upside-down,2023-11-26,1,Delivery driver must have taken a sharp turn because our pizza arrived completely flipped over in the box - all toppings stuck to the lid. Restaurant offered no solution other than suggesting we 'scrape it off and reassemble it.'
False advertising on ingredients,2024-04-15,1,"Menu promised 'house-made Italian sausage' but what came on my pizza was clearly pre-formed, uniform pellets of commercial sausage. When questioned, staff admitted they don't make any ingredients in-house despite menu claims."
Excellent Chicago deep dish,2023-10-08,5,"Hard to find authentic Chicago-style pizza in this area, but they nail it. The buttery, flaky crust, the layering of cheese under the sauce, the chunky tomato topping - all perfect. Worth the 45-minute cook time."
Sauce like ketchup,2023-01-16,2,"The sauce was suspiciously sweet and one-dimensional, reminiscent of ketchup rather than a proper pizza sauce. No evidence of herbs, garlic, or any complexity. Ruined what otherwise could have been a decent pizza."
Outstanding wood-fired perfection,2024-12-24,5,The wood-fired oven gives their pizza a distinctive smoky complexity you can't get any other way. The slight char adds bitterness that balances the sweetness of the sauce perfectly. Worth seeking out for this unique flavor profile.
Perfect for lunch specials,2023-03-30,4,"Their lunch deal is unbeatable - $10 for a 10-inch pizza and small salad. The pizza comes out quickly, is always fresh, and the perfect size for one person. Great place for a work lunch."
Innovative flavor combinations,2023-05-09,5,"Their 'Avant Garde' menu section features combinations I would never have thought of but somehow work perfectly. The pear, gorgonzola, walnut, and honey pizza was a revelation of sweet, salty, and savory harmony."
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2023-09-13,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Weird aftertaste,2025-06-12,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."
Expert-level pizza folding,2023-10-18,5,Their thin-crust slices fold perfectly New York-style without cracking or losing toppings. The slight resistance before the fold is exactly what you want - showing the perfect balance of crisp and chew.
Excellent customer service,2024-10-02,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
Too much garlic,2023-01-10,3,"I love garlic but this was excessive - felt like they mistook cloves for teaspoons in the recipe. My breath was lethal afterward, and the powerful flavor overwhelmed the other ingredients."
No-cheese option was all sauce,2024-06-23,2,"Ordered a cheese-free pizza for my dairy-allergic friend, but they made no adjustments - just removed the cheese and left a soggy sauce-covered bread. Good pizza without cheese requires rebalancing other elements."
Righteous ranch drizzle,2024-06-11,5,Their house-made ranch drizzle takes their pizzas to another level. It's not your typical ranch - has hints of dill and garlic with a perfect consistency that adds creaminess without making things soggy.
Outstanding breakfast pizza,2023-09-16,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
False advertising on size,2023-01-13,2,"Their menu clearly states that a large pizza is 16 inches, but what we received couldn't have been more than 14 inches. When questioned, they claimed their menu was outdated but refused any adjustment."
Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2023-04-25,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies. The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."

Perfect for big groups,2023-04-04,5,"We had a party of 12 and they accommodated us perfectly. Their 20-inch shareable pizzas are great for groups, and they were happy to do half-and-half toppings to please everyone. Service was impressively coordinated."
Perfect buffalo mozzarella application,2024-09-24,5,They understand that buffalo mozzarella shouldn't be cooked too long or it loses its distinctive texture and flavor. Applied in dollops after the pizza is mostly baked so it just barely melts while maintaining its creamy integrity. Technical perfection!
Too salty,2024-12-17,2,"Everything I tried was oversalted - the crust, the sauce, and especially the cheese. It was like they were trying to ensure you'd order more drinks. Couldn't finish my pizza and was thirsty all night."
Righteous ranch drizzle,2024-05-23,5,Their house-made ranch drizzle takes their pizzas to another level. It's not your typical ranch - has hints of dill and garlic with a perfect consistency that adds creaminess without making things soggy.
Tomato sauce tasted rancid,2024-09-08,1,"The sauce had a distinctly off flavor that suggested the tomatoes had gone bad before processing. After two bites, couldn't continue eating as the rancid notes became more pronounced. Basic food safety seems questionable."
Excellent wine pairings,2025-01-12,5,"Their curated wine list is designed specifically to pair with their pizzas, and the staff is knowledgeable about suggesting the perfect match. The house red with their sausage pizza is a transcendent combination."
Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2024-08-07,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies.

Perfect for watching sports,2023-04-30,4,"Great setup with TVs visible from every table, excellent pitcher specials during games, and their 'Game Day' pizza loaded with multiple meats and jalapeños is the perfect sports-watching food. Atmosphere gets lively but not obnoxious."
Burnt crust ruins it,2023-11-08,2,"They claim 'char' is part of the Neapolitan experience, but there's a difference between char and burnt. The entire bottom of my pizza was black and bitter. Scraping it off meant losing half the crust."
Excellent for takeout,2024-05-17,4,"Their pizza travels remarkably well. Even after a 20-minute drive home, the crust was still crispy and everything was at the perfect temperature. They have their packaging technique down to a science."
Pizza barely survived the drive home,2023-05-18,2,"Ordered takeout and by the time I got home (15 minutes), the pizza was a soggy mess. They clearly don't use appropriate packaging for takeout - no vents to release steam means the crust steams itself into sogginess."
Not enough cheese,2024-01-04,3,"The sauce and crust were good, but they're stingy with cheese. You could see the sauce through the sparse cheese layer, and what was there didn't have that stretchy pull you want from a good pizza."
Too much cheese,2024-04-27,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Authentic Italian experience,2024-01-23,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."

Late night savior,2023-02-17,4,"Open until 2am on weekends, this place has saved me many times after a night out. Their slices are huge, reheated perfectly crisp, and they have creative toppings that hit the spot when you're hungry late at night."

Crispy yet chewy perfection,2023-11-03,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."
Too much cornmeal,2023-05-23,3,"They use cornmeal on the bottom of the crust to prevent sticking, which is standard, but they use so much that it's like eating pizza on a sandpaper surface. Gritty texture overwhelms the experience."
Too much sauce,2024-04-23,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Masterclass in proper baking,2024-07-09,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
Excellent for takeout,2023-05-02,4,"Their pizza travels remarkably well. Even after a 20-minute drive home, the crust was still crispy and everything was at the perfect temperature. They have their packaging technique down to a science."
Too noisy for conversation,2023-05-05,3,The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option.
Perfect for lunch specials,2024-07-17,4,"Their lunch deal is unbeatable - $10 for a 10-inch pizza and small salad. The pizza comes out quickly, is always fresh, and the perfect size for one person. Great place for a work lunch."
Skimpy on toppings,2024-04-13,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."

Perfect temperature every time,2024-11-13,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2025-04-10,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
Painfully obvious cheap ingredients,2024-11-01,2,"The pre-shredded cheese didn't melt properly, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the sausage had that distinctive processed flavor. At these prices, cutting corners on ingredients is inexcusable."

Too much cornmeal,2023-04-21,3,"They use cornmeal on the bottom of the crust to prevent sticking, which is standard, but they use so much that it's like eating pizza on a sandpaper surface. Gritty texture overwhelms the experience."
All style no substance,2025-01-26,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."
Perfect for large parties,2024-01-20,5,"Their party package is fantastic - multiple 18-inch pizzas with varied toppings, plenty of sides, and they were accommodating with our group of 20. Everything arrived hot and on time, and they included all the necessary paper goods."
Unmelted cheese in the center,2024-11-08,2,"The edges were fine but the center had cold, unmelted cheese - a sign the oven wasn't hot enough or the pizza wasn't cooked long enough. Basic pizza fundamentals seem to be lacking."
Best Hawaiian in the city,2023-06-22,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."

Spicy special was too much,2024-06-20,2,Their 'Firebreather' pizza should come with a warning label. It wasn't enjoyably spicy - it was painfully hot to the point where I couldn't taste anything else. Had to throw most of it away.
Too thin to be satisfying,2023-10-26,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Rude staff ruined the meal,2025-02-02,2,"The pizza itself was decent, but the counter staff was incredibly rude - sighing when I asked questions about ingredients, rushing my order, and actually rolling their eyes when I requested extra napkins."

Tiny portion sizes,2023-05-20,2,"Their 'personal' pizza is the size of a CD. For $15, I expected something that would actually satisfy my hunger. Had to order a second one, turning a quick lunch into an expensive disappointment."
Perfect for picky eaters,2024-09-07,4,Their 'build your own quarter' option is genius - a large pizza divided into quadrants with different toppings. Perfect for our family where everyone wants something different. No more ordering multiple pizzas!
Perfect for large parties,2025-06-20,5,"Their party package is fantastic - multiple 18-inch pizzas with varied toppings, plenty of sides, and they were accommodating with our group of 20. Everything arrived hot and on time, and they included all the necessary paper goods."
Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2024-05-14,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
Masterclass in proper baking,2024-03-25,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
Brilliant use of fermented dough,2023-04-18,5,Their 72-hour fermented dough has incredible depth of flavor with subtle sourdough notes. The extended fermentation creates a complex web of flavors and perfect texture that you simply can't achieve with quick-rise methods.
Late night savior,2023-06-22,4,"Open until 2am on weekends, this place has saved me many times after a night out. Their slices are huge, reheated perfectly crisp, and they have creative toppings that hit the spot when you're hungry late at night."
Great gluten-free option,2024-07-28,4,"As someone with celiac disease, finding good gluten-free pizza is a challenge. Their cauliflower crust was one of the best I've had - doesn't fall apart and has a nice flavor. Toppings were generous too."
Cheese solidified too quickly,2024-03-22,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Perfect thin crust,2023-03-08,5,"If you're a thin crust fan, this is your place. Cracker-thin, crispy all the way through, yet somehow still has a nice chew. Their simple cheese pizza showcases their excellent sauce - slightly sweet with a nice herb blend."
Excellent for takeout,2025-03-02,4,"Their pizza travels remarkably well. Even after a 20-minute drive home, the crust was still crispy and everything was at the perfect temperature. They have their packaging technique down to a science."
Exceptional sauce-making technique,2023-07-19,5,"You can tell their sauce is made with properly hand-crushed tomatoes - it has that perfect texture with small chunks rather than being completely smooth. The bright flavor suggests minimal cooking, allowing the tomato quality to shine."
Perfect crunch factor,2024-12-05,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."
Innovative flavor combinations,2024-12-19,5,"Their 'Avant Garde' menu section features combinations I would never have thought of but somehow work perfectly. The pear, gorgonzola, walnut, and honey pizza was a revelation of sweet, salty, and savory harmony."
Cold center burnt edges,2023-10-10,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Magnificent flavor layering,2023-11-09,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Excellent wine pairings,2023-04-01,5,"Their curated wine list is designed specifically to pair with their pizzas, and the staff is knowledgeable about suggesting the perfect match. The house red with their sausage pizza is a transcendent combination."
Phenomenal crust,2024-01-02,5,"Whatever they do to their dough is magical - it's got that perfect combination of crispy and chewy with a slight sourdough tang. I could eat their plain crust by itself, it's that good."
Absurdly small slices,2024-05-15,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."
Too much garlic,2024-06-27,3,"I love garlic but this was excessive - felt like they mistook cloves for teaspoons in the recipe. My breath was lethal afterward, and the powerful flavor overwhelmed the other ingredients."
Innovative toppings,2023-12-15,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."
Cheese solidified too quickly,2025-05-07,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Too noisy for conversation,2024-05-31,3,The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option.
Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2024-05-10,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies. The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."
Innovative toppings,2023-12-11,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."
Inconsistent quality,2023-02-27,3,I've been here three times. First visit: amazing. Second: terrible. Third: just okay. Seems like it really depends on who's working that day. Wish they could maintain better quality control.
Too expensive for pizza,2024-11-22,3,"The pizza is good, I'll give them that. But $30 for a basic large cheese pizza is highway robbery. Add toppings and you're looking at $40-50. The quality doesn't justify these premium prices."
Not worth the wait,2023-06-12,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2023-10-17,5,They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!
Excellent customer service,2025-03-13,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
Cheese solidified too quickly,2024-02-20,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Excellence in simplicity,2023-12-23,5,"Their classic Margherita showcases their commitment to quality - the balance of sweet-acidic tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella, fragrant basil, and that perfectly chewy-crisp crust. Proof that simple can be sublime."
Burned mouth on first bite,2024-12-08,2,"They served the pizza dangerously hot - barely out of the oven with no time to cool. Severely burned the roof of my mouth on the first bite, which ruined the rest of the meal and my next few days."
Way too much crust,2023-04-17,2,The edge crust (cornicione) was comically large - almost half of each slice was just bread with no toppings. This ratio of crust to actual pizza was way off and made for a disappointing experience.
Perfect for big groups,2024-03-07,5,"We had a party of 12 and they accommodated us perfectly. Their 20-inch shareable pizzas are great for groups, and they were happy to do half-and-half toppings to please everyone. Service was impressively coordinated."
Bland sauce needs work,2023-05-04,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
Perfect ingredient distribution,2023-06-11,5,"Every bite had the perfect combination of ingredients - no barren spots, no overwhelming clumps. The toppings were distributed with such precision it almost seemed measured. The mark of true professionals!"
Lackluster veggie options,2023-09-01,3,"Their vegetable toppings lacked freshness and flavor - the mushrooms were clearly canned, the peppers were soft and faded, and the onions were sparse. Disappointing for a place that advertises farm-fresh ingredients."
Magnificent flavor layering,2023-07-10,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Supreme quality control,2023-10-10,5,"Visited multiple times and the consistency is impressive - every pizza comes out identical to the last one, with the same excellent quality. Shows serious commitment to training and standards that's rare in casual dining."
Masterclass in proper baking,2025-03-26,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
Ideal char-to-chew ratio,2023-07-04,5,The small charred bubbles on the crust add amazing flavor without dominating. They've mastered that balance between the slight bitterness of char and the natural sweetness of the dough. Technical perfection!
Absurdly small slices,2023-11-19,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."
Excellent customer service,2025-04-10,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
Authentic Italian experience,2024-05-24,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
Outstanding wood-fired perfection,2024-09-26,5,The wood-fired oven gives their pizza a distinctive smoky complexity you can't get any other way. The slight char adds bitterness that balances the sweetness of the sauce perfectly. Worth seeking out for this unique flavor profile.
Outstanding variety of options,2024-12-18,5,"Their menu has something for everyone - traditional options done well, creative specialties, and customizable choices. Even have dessert pizzas that are surprisingly good (try the Nutella and banana!)."
Pizza arrived upside-down,2023-05-01,1,Delivery driver must have taken a sharp turn because our pizza arrived completely flipped over in the box - all toppings stuck to the lid. Restaurant offered no solution other than suggesting we 'scrape it off and reassemble it.'
Excellent wine pairings,2025-02-27,5,"Their curated wine list is designed specifically to pair with their pizzas, and the staff is knowledgeable about suggesting the perfect match. The house red with their sausage pizza is a transcendent combination."

Creative seasonal specials,2024-06-29,5,"Just had their spring special with asparagus, lemon ricotta, and prosciutto. The combination was bright, fresh, and perfect for the season. Love that they use local, seasonal ingredients."

Pizza barely survived the drive home,2024-09-13,2,"Ordered takeout and by the time I got home (15 minutes), the pizza was a soggy mess. They clearly don't use appropriate packaging for takeout - no vents to release steam means the crust steams itself into sogginess."
Rude staff ruined the meal,2024-09-15,2,"The pizza itself was decent, but the counter staff was incredibly rude - sighing when I asked questions about ingredients, rushing my order, and actually rolling their eyes when I requested extra napkins."
Absurdly small slices,2023-06-22,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."
Weird aftertaste,2023-07-04,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."
Exceptional sauce-making technique,2024-04-08,5,"You can tell their sauce is made with properly hand-crushed tomatoes - it has that perfect texture with small chunks rather than being completely smooth. The bright flavor suggests minimal cooking, allowing the tomato quality to shine."

Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2024-01-21,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
Perfect temperature every time,2023-11-07,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
Way too much crust,2025-02-21,2,The edge crust (cornicione) was comically large - almost half of each slice was just bread with no toppings. This ratio of crust to actual pizza was way off and made for a disappointing experience.

Not worth the wait,2024-09-24,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."
Toppings slide right off,2024-03-25,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2024-06-20,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."
Excellence in simplicity,2023-02-05,5,"Their classic Margherita showcases their commitment to quality - the balance of sweet-acidic tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella, fragrant basil, and that perfectly chewy-crisp crust. Proof that simple can be sublime."
Too much emphasis on appearance,2023-03-06,3,"The pizza was clearly designed to look good in photos - perfect symmetry, vibrant colors, photogenic cheese pull - but the flavor was underwhelming. Style over substance for the Instagram crowd."
Way too much crust,2023-09-25,2,The edge crust (cornicione) was comically large - almost half of each slice was just bread with no toppings. This ratio of crust to actual pizza was way off and made for a disappointing experience.
Terrible delivery experience,2024-09-23,1,"Ordered for Valentine's Day and regretted it. Pizza took 2 hours to arrive, was cold, and had the wrong toppings. Called the restaurant and they seemed completely unconcerned. Never again."
Excellent for takeout,2025-02-10,4,"Their pizza travels remarkably well. Even after a 20-minute drive home, the crust was still crispy and everything was at the perfect temperature. They have their packaging technique down to a science."

Disappointed with service,2024-09-27,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."
All style no substance,2025-01-17,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."
Righteous ranch drizzle,2024-04-26,5,Their house-made ranch drizzle takes their pizzas to another level. It's not your typical ranch - has hints of dill and garlic with a perfect consistency that adds creaminess without making things soggy.
Rude staff ruined the meal,2023-07-25,2,"The pizza itself was decent, but the counter staff was incredibly rude - sighing when I asked questions about ingredients, rushing my order, and actually rolling their eyes when I requested extra napkins."
Undercooked in the middle,2024-08-02,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."
Spicy special was too much,2024-04-26,2,Their 'Firebreather' pizza should come with a warning label. It wasn't enjoyably spicy - it was painfully hot to the point where I couldn't taste anything else. Had to throw most of it away.
Perfect for dietary restrictions,2024-12-30,5,"As someone with multiple food allergies, I appreciate that they take dietary concerns seriously. Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"
Sauce like ketchup,2023-05-11,2,"The sauce was suspiciously sweet and one-dimensional, reminiscent of ketchup rather than a proper pizza sauce. No evidence of herbs, garlic, or any complexity. Ruined what otherwise could have been a decent pizza."
Perfect NY-style slices,2024-05-23,5,"As a transplant from NYC, I've been searching for authentic NY-style pizza. This place nails it - thin, foldable slices with the right amount of chew and grease. Their plain cheese slice is perfection."
Inconsistent quality,2024-03-18,3,I've been here three times. First visit: amazing. Second: terrible. Third: just okay. Seems like it really depends on who's working that day. Wish they could maintain better quality control.
Superior ingredients make the difference,2023-05-01,5,"They import their flour from Italy, use San Marzano tomatoes, and make their mozzarella in-house daily. The commitment to quality ingredients is evident in every bite - nothing is an afterthought."
Undercooked in the middle,2024-04-13,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."
Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2023-07-02,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
False advertising on size,2023-12-15,2,"Their menu clearly states that a large pizza is 16 inches, but what we received couldn't have been more than 14 inches. When questioned, they claimed their menu was outdated but refused any adjustment."
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2025-06-25,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Excellent for takeout,2024-06-06,4,"Their pizza travels remarkably well. Even after a 20-minute drive home, the crust was still crispy and everything was at the perfect temperature. They have their packaging technique down to a science."
Too greasy to enjoy,2023-06-14,2,"Had to literally blot my pizza with napkins, which came away completely saturated with grease. Whatever flavor might have been there was drowned in oil. Couldn't finish it as it was making me feel ill."
Excellent beer pairing suggestions,2023-10-17,5,"Not only is their pizza excellent (try the fig and prosciutto!), but the staff is knowledgeable about their craft beer selection and can suggest the perfect pairing for whatever pizza you order."

Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2024-02-04,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
No flavor distinction,2023-05-03,3,Ordered two completely different specialty pizzas but they somehow tasted nearly identical. It's like they use the same base for everything and the toppings don't impart enough distinctive character.
Perfect for large parties,2023-04-21,5,"Their party package is fantastic - multiple 18-inch pizzas with varied toppings, plenty of sides, and they were accommodating with our group of 20. Everything arrived hot and on time, and they included all the necessary paper goods."

Overpriced for what you get,2023-01-28,3,"$24 for a medium pizza with just two toppings seems excessive. The ingredients were fresh and the crust was good, but nothing justified the premium price. There are better values elsewhere in town."

Overpriced for what you get,2025-06-04,3,"$24 for a medium pizza with just two toppings seems excessive. The ingredients were fresh and the crust was good, but nothing justified the premium price. There are better values elsewhere in town."
Refrigerated dough taste,2023-12-19,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2023-09-21,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
Incredible vodka sauce base,2024-07-13,5,"Their vodka sauce pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil is something special. The creamy, slightly spicy sauce is a perfect alternative to traditional tomato sauce. Add prosciutto for an extra flavor dimension!"
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2023-12-11,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Lackluster veggie options,2025-05-14,3,"Their vegetable toppings lacked freshness and flavor - the mushrooms were clearly canned, the peppers were soft and faded, and the onions were sparse. Disappointing for a place that advertises farm-fresh ingredients."
Amazing Detroit-style,2025-03-03,5,"Their Detroit-style square pizza is incredible - crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior, and those corner pieces are to die for! The pepperoni cup and char perfectly. Worth the 30-minute wait."

Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"

Outstanding wood-fired perfection,2024-11-17,5,The wood-fired oven gives their pizza a distinctive smoky complexity you can't get any other way. The slight char adds bitterness that balances the sweetness of the sauce perfectly. Worth seeking out for this unique flavor profile.

Phenomenal crust,2024-01-01,5,"Whatever they do to their dough is magical - it's got that perfect combination of crispy and chewy with a slight sourdough tang. I could eat their plain crust by itself, it's that good."
Stale-tasting crust,2023-12-09,2,"The crust had a stale, almost cardboard-like quality that suggests either old dough or old flour. Fresh ingredients on top couldn't compensate for the foundation being off."

The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."
Perfect for late-night cravings,2023-06-30,5,"Open until 3am on weekends, this place has saved many late nights. The slices are huge, they reheat them perfectly so they're crispy, and their special late-night menu items are creative and delicious."

Doughy and undercooked,2023-01-12,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."

Burned mouth on first bite,2024-10-09,2,"They served the pizza dangerously hot - barely out of the oven with no time to cool. Severely burned the roof of my mouth on the first bite, which ruined the rest of the meal and my next few days."
New owners ruined it,2023-01-18,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."

Outstanding breakfast pizza,2024-04-02,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
Crust like cardboard,2024-05-11,2,"The crust had all the flavor and texture of packing material - dry, tough, and completely devoid of character. Even the decent toppings couldn't save it. The foundation of good pizza is good dough, and this wasn't it."
Too much cheese,2024-04-03,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Too much cheese,2023-12-02,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Exceptional sauce-making technique,2023-09-25,5,"You can tell their sauce is made with properly hand-crushed tomatoes - it has that perfect texture with small chunks rather than being completely smooth. The bright flavor suggests minimal cooking, allowing the tomato quality to shine."
Bland sauce needs work,2023-08-30,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
Perfect for kids' parties,2023-05-01,5,"Hosted my son's birthday here and it was fantastic. They did a dough-tossing demonstration for the kids, let them make their own mini pizzas, and the staff was incredibly patient and kind."
Excellent customer service,2024-12-21,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
Not worth the wait,2025-03-20,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."
Toppings slide right off,2023-09-03,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Way too much crust,2025-02-11,2,The edge crust (cornicione) was comically large - almost half of each slice was just bread with no toppings. This ratio of crust to actual pizza was way off and made for a disappointing experience.
Disappointed with service,2023-11-20,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."
Creative seasonal specials,2023-04-30,5,"Just had their spring special with asparagus, lemon ricotta, and prosciutto. The combination was bright, fresh, and perfect for the season. Love that they use local, seasonal ingredients."
Perfect for late-night cravings,2025-03-03,5,"Open until 3am on weekends, this place has saved many late nights. The slices are huge, they reheat them perfectly so they're crispy, and their special late-night menu items are creative and delicious."
Terrible delivery experience,2025-01-08,1,"Ordered for Valentine's Day and regretted it. Pizza took 2 hours to arrive, was cold, and had the wrong toppings. Called the restaurant and they seemed completely unconcerned. Never again."
Dirty restaurant,2023-11-27,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."
Stale-tasting crust,2025-06-28,2,"The crust had a stale, almost cardboard-like quality that suggests either old dough or old flour. Fresh ingredients on top couldn't compensate for the foundation being off."
Bland sauce needs work,2023-08-30,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
Perfect ingredient distribution,2024-02-18,5,"Every bite had the perfect combination of ingredients - no barren spots, no overwhelming clumps. The toppings were distributed with such precision it almost seemed measured. The mark of true professionals!"
Perfect for picky eaters,2024-09-07,4,Their 'build your own quarter' option is genius - a large pizza divided into quadrants with different toppings. Perfect for our family where everyone wants something different. No more ordering multiple pizzas!
Mediocre at best,2023-02-10,3,"Nothing terrible but nothing special either. The crust was okay, toppings were standard, and service was fine. It's the kind of place you go when you're in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip for."
Doughy and undercooked,2025-01-30,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Perfect ingredient distribution,2025-02-14,5,"Every bite had the perfect combination of ingredients - no barren spots, no overwhelming clumps. The toppings were distributed with such precision it almost seemed measured. The mark of true professionals!"
Perfect for late-night cravings,2023-01-13,5,"Open until 3am on weekends, this place has saved many late nights. The slices are huge, they reheat them perfectly so they're crispy, and their special late-night menu items are creative and delicious."
Innovative flavor combinations,2024-06-14,5,"Their 'Avant Garde' menu section features combinations I would never have thought of but somehow work perfectly. The pear, gorgonzola, walnut, and honey pizza was a revelation of sweet, salty, and savory harmony."
Skimpy on toppings,2023-01-19,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."
Stale-tasting crust,2025-06-06,2,"The crust had a stale, almost cardboard-like quality that suggests either old dough or old flour. Fresh ingredients on top couldn't compensate for the foundation being off."
Late night savior,2024-03-21,4,"Open until 2am on weekends, this place has saved me many times after a night out. Their slices are huge, reheated perfectly crisp, and they have creative toppings that hit the spot when you're hungry late at night."
Way too much oregano,2024-09-16,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
New owners ruined it,2024-06-11,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2024-10-12,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."
Perfect crunch factor,2024-05-22,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."
Epic meat lovers option,2023-01-14,4,"If you're a carnivore, their 'Butcher's Block' pizza is incredible. Five different meats, all high quality - the soppressata and house-made sausage are standouts. Just be ready for a food coma afterward!"
Outstanding wood-fired perfection,2024-07-31,5,The wood-fired oven gives their pizza a distinctive smoky complexity you can't get any other way. The slight char adds bitterness that balances the sweetness of the sauce perfectly. Worth seeking out for this unique flavor profile.
Brilliant seasonal rotation,2023-03-27,5,"Love that they have a rotating seasonal pizza that showcases what's fresh. The current spring offering with asparagus, green garlic, and fresh peas is bright and delicious - a perfect reflection of the season."
Tomato sauce tasted rancid,2023-03-25,1,"The sauce had a distinctly off flavor that suggested the tomatoes had gone bad before processing. After two bites, couldn't continue eating as the rancid notes became more pronounced. Basic food safety seems questionable."
Best pizza in town,2024-10-01,5,"The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Their signature pepperoni pizza had the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, and the pepperoni curled up into little cups of deliciousness. Will definitely be back!"
Cheese solidified too quickly,2024-08-03,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Cold center burnt edges,2024-09-14,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Excellence in simplicity,2025-06-10,5,"Their classic Margherita showcases their commitment to quality - the balance of sweet-acidic tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella, fragrant basil, and that perfectly chewy-crisp crust. Proof that simple can be sublime."

Way too much crust,2023-11-04,2,The edge crust (cornicione) was comically large - almost half of each slice was just bread with no toppings. This ratio of crust to actual pizza was way off and made for a disappointing experience.
Absurdly small slices,2023-10-01,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."
Excellent attention to cooking time,2024-07-20,5,They nail the cooking time perfectly - pulling the pizza from the oven at exactly the right moment when the cheese is fully melted and bubbling but not yet browned. Shows expertise and attention to detail.
Exceptional sauce-making technique,2023-11-21,5,"You can tell their sauce is made with properly hand-crushed tomatoes - it has that perfect texture with small chunks rather than being completely smooth. The bright flavor suggests minimal cooking, allowing the tomato quality to shine."
False advertising on size,2023-08-03,2,"Their menu clearly states that a large pizza is 16 inches, but what we received couldn't have been more than 14 inches. When questioned, they claimed their menu was outdated but refused any adjustment."
Bland sauce needs work,2024-05-04,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
Underwhelming and basic,2024-04-12,3,"Nothing particularly wrong with it, but nothing memorable either. Standard crust, standard sauce, standard toppings. In a city with so many pizza options, this place doesn't give you any reason to return."
Exceptional sauce-making technique,2024-03-20,5,"You can tell their sauce is made with properly hand-crushed tomatoes - it has that perfect texture with small chunks rather than being completely smooth. The bright flavor suggests minimal cooking, allowing the tomato quality to shine."
Perfect NY-style slices,2024-11-21,5,"As a transplant from NYC, I've been searching for authentic NY-style pizza. This place nails it - thin, foldable slices with the right amount of chew and grease. Their plain cheese slice is perfection."
No flavor distinction,2024-05-19,3,Ordered two completely different specialty pizzas but they somehow tasted nearly identical. It's like they use the same base for everything and the toppings don't impart enough distinctive character.
Too much cornmeal,2023-09-06,3,"They use cornmeal on the bottom of the crust to prevent sticking, which is standard, but they use so much that it's like eating pizza on a sandpaper surface. Gritty texture overwhelms the experience."
Phenomenal crust,2023-10-29,5,"Whatever they do to their dough is magical - it's got that perfect combination of crispy and chewy with a slight sourdough tang. I could eat their plain crust by itself, it's that good."
Too much salt in the dough,2024-05-13,2,The crust was so salty it was almost inedible - overwhelmed all the other flavors and left me incredibly thirsty afterward. A heavy hand with salt ruined what could have been a good pizza.
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2023-07-09,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
Not worth the wait,2024-10-31,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."
Unmelted cheese in the center,2025-02-09,2,"The edges were fine but the center had cold, unmelted cheese - a sign the oven wasn't hot enough or the pizza wasn't cooked long enough. Basic pizza fundamentals seem to be lacking."
Amazing Detroit-style,2023-02-13,5,"Their Detroit-style square pizza is incredible - crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior, and those corner pieces are to die for! The pepperoni cup and char perfectly. Worth the 30-minute wait."
Too much sauce,2023-09-13,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
No-cheese option was all sauce,2024-12-23,2,"Ordered a cheese-free pizza for my dairy-allergic friend, but they made no adjustments - just removed the cheese and left a soggy sauce-covered bread. Good pizza without cheese requires rebalancing other elements."
Superior ingredients make the difference,2023-05-19,5,"They import their flour from Italy, use San Marzano tomatoes, and make their mozzarella in-house daily. The commitment to quality ingredients is evident in every bite - nothing is an afterthought."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2023-11-05,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Perfect crust-to-topping ratio,2024-11-16,5,"Some places overload toppings so the crust gets soggy, others are too sparse. This place gets it perfect - enough toppings to get some in every bite, but not so much that the structural integrity is compromised."
Painfully obvious cheap ingredients,2023-01-13,2,"The pre-shredded cheese didn't melt properly, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the sausage had that distinctive processed flavor. At these prices, cutting corners on ingredients is inexcusable."
Excellent wine pairings,2024-11-27,5,"Their curated wine list is designed specifically to pair with their pizzas, and the staff is knowledgeable about suggesting the perfect match. The house red with their sausage pizza is a transcendent combination."
Too much cornmeal,2024-01-09,3,"They use cornmeal on the bottom of the crust to prevent sticking, which is standard, but they use so much that it's like eating pizza on a sandpaper surface. Gritty texture overwhelms the experience."
Too much sauce,2024-11-08,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Excellence in simplicity,2024-01-25,5,"Their classic Margherita showcases their commitment to quality - the balance of sweet-acidic tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella, fragrant basil, and that perfectly chewy-crisp crust. Proof that simple can be sublime."
Best Hawaiian in the city,2023-11-30,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."
Too much emphasis on appearance,2024-06-24,3,"The pizza was clearly designed to look good in photos - perfect symmetry, vibrant colors, photogenic cheese pull - but the flavor was underwhelming. Style over substance for the Instagram crowd."
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2024-12-29,5,They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!
All style no substance,2024-07-15,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."
Terrible delivery experience,2023-06-21,1,"Ordered for Valentine's Day and regretted it. Pizza took 2 hours to arrive, was cold, and had the wrong toppings. Called the restaurant and they seemed completely unconcerned. Never again."
Great gluten-free option,2023-09-23,4,"As someone with celiac disease, finding good gluten-free pizza is a challenge. Their cauliflower crust was one of the best I've had - doesn't fall apart and has a nice flavor. Toppings were generous too."
Outstanding wood-fired perfection,2023-02-23,5,The wood-fired oven gives their pizza a distinctive smoky complexity you can't get any other way. The slight char adds bitterness that balances the sweetness of the sauce perfectly. Worth seeking out for this unique flavor profile.
Righteous ranch drizzle,2025-02-10,5,Their house-made ranch drizzle takes their pizzas to another level. It's not your typical ranch - has hints of dill and garlic with a perfect consistency that adds creaminess without making things soggy.
Authentic coal-fired perfection,2024-12-25,5,Their coal-fired oven gives the pizza a distinctive char and smoky flavor that's impossible to replicate any other way. The slight bitterness of the charred spots perfectly balances the sweetness of the sauce.
Perfect for dietary restrictions,2024-11-05,5,"As someone with multiple food allergies, I appreciate that they take dietary concerns seriously. Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"
Epic meat lovers option,2024-06-29,4,"If you're a carnivore, their 'Butcher's Block' pizza is incredible. Five different meats, all high quality - the soppressata and house-made sausage are standouts. Just be ready for a food coma afterward!"

Family night favorite,2023-01-05,5,"We bring our kids here every Friday night. The staff always make them feel special, providing dough for them to play with while we wait. Their kid-sized pizzas are perfect, and the parents love the craft beer selection."
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2024-05-02,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."
Righteous ranch drizzle,2024-05-09,5,Their house-made ranch drizzle takes their pizzas to another level. It's not your typical ranch - has hints of dill and garlic with a perfect consistency that adds creaminess without making things soggy.
Expert-level pizza folding,2023-05-08,5,Their thin-crust slices fold perfectly New York-style without cracking or losing toppings. The slight resistance before the fold is exactly what you want - showing the perfect balance of crisp and chew.
Too much garlic,2023-05-15,3,"I love garlic but this was excessive - felt like they mistook cloves for teaspoons in the recipe. My breath was lethal afterward, and the powerful flavor overwhelmed the other ingredients."
Bland sauce needs work,2025-01-08,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
Authentic Italian experience,2025-02-06,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
Weird aftertaste,2024-08-06,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."
Brilliant seasonal rotation,2023-04-24,5,"Love that they have a rotating seasonal pizza that showcases what's fresh. The current spring offering with asparagus, green garlic, and fresh peas is bright and delicious - a perfect reflection of the season."

Too much emphasis on appearance,2024-07-02,3,"The pizza was clearly designed to look good in photos - perfect symmetry, vibrant colors, photogenic cheese pull - but the flavor was underwhelming. Style over substance for the Instagram crowd."
Burnt crust ruins it,2023-07-11,2,"They claim 'char' is part of the Neapolitan experience, but there's a difference between char and burnt. The entire bottom of my pizza was black and bitter. Scraping it off meant losing half the crust."
Excellent beer pairing suggestions,2025-05-13,5,"Not only is their pizza excellent (try the fig and prosciutto!), but the staff is knowledgeable about their craft beer selection and can suggest the perfect pairing for whatever pizza you order."
Burned bottom raw top,2024-11-09,1,The bottom of the crust was completely black while the cheese on top wasn't fully melted. This temperature imbalance suggests serious issues with their oven management and pizza-making technique.
Refrigerated dough taste,2023-12-15,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."
Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2024-09-23,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies. The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."
Incredible vodka sauce base,2024-08-21,5,"Their vodka sauce pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil is something special. The creamy, slightly spicy sauce is a perfect alternative to traditional tomato sauce. Add prosciutto for an extra flavor dimension!"

Dirty restaurant,2025-01-18,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."
Excellent for takeout,2024-08-25,4,"Their pizza travels remarkably well. Even after a 20-minute drive home, the crust was still crispy and everything was at the perfect temperature. They have their packaging technique down to a science."
False advertising on size,2024-02-15,2,"Their menu clearly states that a large pizza is 16 inches, but what we received couldn't have been more than 14 inches. When questioned, they claimed their menu was outdated but refused any adjustment."
Inconsistent quality,2025-02-12,3,I've been here three times. First visit: amazing. Second: terrible. Third: just okay. Seems like it really depends on who's working that day. Wish they could maintain better quality control.
Disappointed with service,2025-05-23,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."

Best white pizza ever,2023-08-12,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"
Too much cornmeal,2023-04-24,3,"They use cornmeal on the bottom of the crust to prevent sticking, which is standard, but they use so much that it's like eating pizza on a sandpaper surface. Gritty texture overwhelms the experience."
Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2024-05-13,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
Exceptional spinach ricotta pie,2023-05-15,5,Their white pizza with spinach and ricotta is exceptional - the creamy richness of the cheese balanced by the slight bitterness of the greens. The garlic-infused olive oil base ties everything together perfectly.
Excellent customer service,2023-05-26,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
Pizza arrived upside-down,2023-04-20,1,Delivery driver must have taken a sharp turn because our pizza arrived completely flipped over in the box - all toppings stuck to the lid. Restaurant offered no solution other than suggesting we 'scrape it off and reassemble it.'
Crispy yet chewy perfection,2024-09-20,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."

Outstanding breakfast pizza,2024-12-23,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
Perfect for late-night cravings,2023-09-09,5,"Open until 3am on weekends, this place has saved many late nights. The slices are huge, they reheat them perfectly so they're crispy, and their special late-night menu items are creative and delicious."
Great gluten-free option,2025-02-24,4,"As someone with celiac disease, finding good gluten-free pizza is a challenge. Their cauliflower crust was one of the best I've had - doesn't fall apart and has a nice flavor. Toppings were generous too."
Perfectly crispy crust,2025-01-27,5,"However they achieve it, their crust has the perfect crispness all the way through - no soggy middle! Even the slices with lots of toppings maintain their structural integrity. Engineering marvel of pizza."
Rude staff ruined the meal,2024-04-24,2,"The pizza itself was decent, but the counter staff was incredibly rude - sighing when I asked questions about ingredients, rushing my order, and actually rolling their eyes when I requested extra napkins."

Perfect temperature every time,2025-02-03,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
No-cheese option was all sauce,2025-03-19,2,"Ordered a cheese-free pizza for my dairy-allergic friend, but they made no adjustments - just removed the cheese and left a soggy sauce-covered bread. Good pizza without cheese requires rebalancing other elements."

Not worth the wait,2024-12-24,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."
Too thin to be satisfying,2024-10-21,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Perfect for late-night cravings,2024-05-30,5,"Open until 3am on weekends, this place has saved many late nights. The slices are huge, they reheat them perfectly so they're crispy, and their special late-night menu items are creative and delicious."
No flavor distinction,2023-03-12,3,Ordered two completely different specialty pizzas but they somehow tasted nearly identical. It's like they use the same base for everything and the toppings don't impart enough distinctive character.
Exceptional spinach ricotta pie,2024-01-01,5,Their white pizza with spinach and ricotta is exceptional - the creamy richness of the cheese balanced by the slight bitterness of the greens. The garlic-infused olive oil base ties everything together perfectly.
Stale-tasting crust,2023-10-20,2,"The crust had a stale, almost cardboard-like quality that suggests either old dough or old flour. Fresh ingredients on top couldn't compensate for the foundation being off."
Too noisy for conversation,2024-03-14,3,The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option.
Underwhelming and basic,2025-01-09,3,"Nothing particularly wrong with it, but nothing memorable either. Standard crust, standard sauce, standard toppings. In a city with so many pizza options, this place doesn't give you any reason to return."
Cold center burnt edges,2024-07-26,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Excellence in simplicity,2025-03-16,5,"Their classic Margherita showcases their commitment to quality - the balance of sweet-acidic tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella, fragrant basil, and that perfectly chewy-crisp crust. Proof that simple can be sublime."
Perfect for late-night cravings,2024-04-11,5,"Open until 3am on weekends, this place has saved many late nights. The slices are huge, they reheat them perfectly so they're crispy, and their special late-night menu items are creative and delicious."
Innovative toppings,2025-03-12,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."
Too much salt in the dough,2023-10-13,2,The crust was so salty it was almost inedible - overwhelmed all the other flavors and left me incredibly thirsty afterward. A heavy hand with salt ruined what could have been a good pizza.
Burnt crust ruins it,2023-11-25,2,"They claim 'char' is part of the Neapolitan experience, but there's a difference between char and burnt. The entire bottom of my pizza was black and bitter. Scraping it off meant losing half the crust."
Toppings slide right off,2025-04-12,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Perfect textural contrast,2023-01-11,5,"The contrast between the crisp bottom, the tender interior crumb, the gooey cheese, and the slight resistance of the toppings creates a textural symphony. Each bite is interesting and satisfying in a different way."
Rude staff ruined the meal,2025-01-01,2,"The pizza itself was decent, but the counter staff was incredibly rude - sighing when I asked questions about ingredients, rushing my order, and actually rolling their eyes when I requested extra napkins."
Pizza barely survived the drive home,2024-02-19,2,"Ordered takeout and by the time I got home (15 minutes), the pizza was a soggy mess. They clearly don't use appropriate packaging for takeout - no vents to release steam means the crust steams itself into sogginess."
Burnt crust ruins it,2023-10-03,2,"They claim 'char' is part of the Neapolitan experience, but there's a difference between char and burnt. The entire bottom of my pizza was black and bitter. Scraping it off meant losing half the crust."
Perfect textural contrast,2023-01-08,5,"The contrast between the crisp bottom, the tender interior crumb, the gooey cheese, and the slight resistance of the toppings creates a textural symphony. Each bite is interesting and satisfying in a different way."
Perfect crunch factor,2025-02-20,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."
Spicy special was too much,2024-09-19,2,Their 'Firebreather' pizza should come with a warning label. It wasn't enjoyably spicy - it was painfully hot to the point where I couldn't taste anything else. Had to throw most of it away.
No flavor distinction,2024-09-06,3,Ordered two completely different specialty pizzas but they somehow tasted nearly identical. It's like they use the same base for everything and the toppings don't impart enough distinctive character.
Overpriced for what you get,2023-01-19,3,"$24 for a medium pizza with just two toppings seems excessive. The ingredients were fresh and the crust was good, but nothing justified the premium price. There are better values elsewhere in town."
Too much garlic,2023-06-28,3,"I love garlic but this was excessive - felt like they mistook cloves for teaspoons in the recipe. My breath was lethal afterward, and the powerful flavor overwhelmed the other ingredients."
Perfect for big groups,2023-06-02,5,"We had a party of 12 and they accommodated us perfectly. Their 20-inch shareable pizzas are great for groups, and they were happy to do half-and-half toppings to please everyone. Service was impressively coordinated."
Perfect buffalo mozzarella application,2024-04-19,5,They understand that buffalo mozzarella shouldn't be cooked too long or it loses its distinctive texture and flavor. Applied in dollops after the pizza is mostly baked so it just barely melts while maintaining its creamy integrity. Technical perfection!
Too greasy to enjoy,2024-05-14,2,"Had to literally blot my pizza with napkins, which came away completely saturated with grease. Whatever flavor might have been there was drowned in oil. Couldn't finish it as it was making me feel ill."
Phenomenal crust,2023-01-25,5,"Whatever they do to their dough is magical - it's got that perfect combination of crispy and chewy with a slight sourdough tang. I could eat their plain crust by itself, it's that good."
Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2023-02-28,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
Authentic Italian experience,2023-07-31,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
Crust like cardboard,2024-06-15,2,"The crust had all the flavor and texture of packing material - dry, tough, and completely devoid of character. Even the decent toppings couldn't save it. The foundation of good pizza is good dough, and this wasn't it."
Absurdly small slices,2023-06-06,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."
Perfect crunch factor,2023-11-10,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."
Best Hawaiian in the city,2024-09-10,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."
Best white pizza ever,2024-09-19,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"
Underwhelming and basic,2025-03-27,3,"Nothing particularly wrong with it, but nothing memorable either. Standard crust, standard sauce, standard toppings. In a city with so many pizza options, this place doesn't give you any reason to return."
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2023-05-09,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."
Lackluster veggie options,2025-03-23,3,"Their vegetable toppings lacked freshness and flavor - the mushrooms were clearly canned, the peppers were soft and faded, and the onions were sparse. Disappointing for a place that advertises farm-fresh ingredients."
Perfect NY-style slices,2024-12-10,5,"As a transplant from NYC, I've been searching for authentic NY-style pizza. This place nails it - thin, foldable slices with the right amount of chew and grease. Their plain cheese slice is perfection."
Exceptional spinach ricotta pie,2023-10-04,5,Their white pizza with spinach and ricotta is exceptional - the creamy richness of the cheese balanced by the slight bitterness of the greens. The garlic-infused olive oil base ties everything together perfectly.
All style no substance,2024-09-12,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."
Righteous ranch drizzle,2025-05-17,5,Their house-made ranch drizzle takes their pizzas to another level. It's not your typical ranch - has hints of dill and garlic with a perfect consistency that adds creaminess without making things soggy.
Inconsistent quality,2023-09-04,3,I've been here three times. First visit: amazing. Second: terrible. Third: just okay. Seems like it really depends on who's working that day. Wish they could maintain better quality control.
Best pizza in town,2024-01-17,5,"The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Their signature pepperoni pizza had the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, and the pepperoni curled up into little cups of deliciousness. Will definitely be back!"
Too much sauce,2025-02-09,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Exceptional sauce-making technique,2024-08-29,5,"You can tell their sauce is made with properly hand-crushed tomatoes - it has that perfect texture with small chunks rather than being completely smooth. The bright flavor suggests minimal cooking, allowing the tomato quality to shine."
Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2024-05-22,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
No-cheese option was all sauce,2025-06-27,2,"Ordered a cheese-free pizza for my dairy-allergic friend, but they made no adjustments - just removed the cheese and left a soggy sauce-covered bread. Good pizza without cheese requires rebalancing other elements."
Sloppy presentation,2023-11-11,3,"The pizza looked like it had been assembled in a hurry - toppings haphazardly thrown on, cheese unevenly distributed, and the cutting was so uneven that some slices were twice the size of others. Taste was okay, but appearance matters too."
Spicy special was too much,2025-05-27,2,Their 'Firebreather' pizza should come with a warning label. It wasn't enjoyably spicy - it was painfully hot to the point where I couldn't taste anything else. Had to throw most of it away.
Best pizza in town,2024-07-14,5,"The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Their signature pepperoni pizza had the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, and the pepperoni curled up into little cups of deliciousness. Will definitely be back!"
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2023-12-26,5,They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!
Skimpy on toppings,2023-10-25,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2023-10-05,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Perfect for picky eaters,2023-02-21,4,Their 'build your own quarter' option is genius - a large pizza divided into quadrants with different toppings. Perfect for our family where everyone wants something different. No more ordering multiple pizzas!
Masterclass in proper baking,2025-03-21,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
Phenomenal crust,2024-11-11,5,"Whatever they do to their dough is magical - it's got that perfect combination of crispy and chewy with a slight sourdough tang. I could eat their plain crust by itself, it's that good."
Perfect thin crust,2024-05-15,5,"If you're a thin crust fan, this is your place. Cracker-thin, crispy all the way through, yet somehow still has a nice chew. Their simple cheese pizza showcases their excellent sauce - slightly sweet with a nice herb blend."
Spicy special was too much,2025-01-19,2,Their 'Firebreather' pizza should come with a warning label. It wasn't enjoyably spicy - it was painfully hot to the point where I couldn't taste anything else. Had to throw most of it away.
Epic meat lovers option,2025-05-07,4,"If you're a carnivore, their 'Butcher's Block' pizza is incredible. Five different meats, all high quality - the soppressata and house-made sausage are standouts. Just be ready for a food coma afterward!"
Authentic Italian experience,2023-06-16,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
Not enough cheese,2023-10-16,3,"The sauce and crust were good, but they're stingy with cheese. You could see the sauce through the sparse cheese layer, and what was there didn't have that stretchy pull you want from a good pizza."
Excessive grease pooling,2023-11-18,2,"Had to continuously blot the pizza with napkins as pools of orange grease formed on top of the cheese with every passing minute. By the end, the napkins were completely saturated and transparent. Felt unhealthy even by pizza standards."
Too noisy for conversation,2024-10-09,3,The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option.
Excessive grease pooling,2023-08-15,2,"Had to continuously blot the pizza with napkins as pools of orange grease formed on top of the cheese with every passing minute. By the end, the napkins were completely saturated and transparent. Felt unhealthy even by pizza standards."
Expert-level pizza folding,2024-06-05,5,Their thin-crust slices fold perfectly New York-style without cracking or losing toppings. The slight resistance before the fold is exactly what you want - showing the perfect balance of crisp and chew.
Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2023-06-20,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies. The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."
Tasteless cheese substitute,2023-02-06,2,"Their vegan cheese option was terrible - had no meltability, a grainy texture, and tasted strongly of coconut which clashed with the tomato sauce. If you can't do vegan cheese well, better to offer cheese-free options that are properly balanced."
Ideal char-to-chew ratio,2024-01-03,5,The small charred bubbles on the crust add amazing flavor without dominating. They've mastered that balance between the slight bitterness of char and the natural sweetness of the dough. Technical perfection!
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2023-09-13,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Brilliant seasonal rotation,2023-06-24,5,"Love that they have a rotating seasonal pizza that showcases what's fresh. The current spring offering with asparagus, green garlic, and fresh peas is bright and delicious - a perfect reflection of the season."
Inconsistent quality,2023-02-09,3,I've been here three times. First visit: amazing. Second: terrible. Third: just okay. Seems like it really depends on who's working that day. Wish they could maintain better quality control.
Ideal char-to-chew ratio,2025-06-12,5,The small charred bubbles on the crust add amazing flavor without dominating. They've mastered that balance between the slight bitterness of char and the natural sweetness of the dough. Technical perfection!
Unmelted cheese in the center,2025-04-20,2,"The edges were fine but the center had cold, unmelted cheese - a sign the oven wasn't hot enough or the pizza wasn't cooked long enough. Basic pizza fundamentals seem to be lacking."
Perfect for large parties,2025-06-13,5,"Their party package is fantastic - multiple 18-inch pizzas with varied toppings, plenty of sides, and they were accommodating with our group of 20. Everything arrived hot and on time, and they included all the necessary paper goods."
Expert-level pizza folding,2025-03-06,5,Their thin-crust slices fold perfectly New York-style without cracking or losing toppings. The slight resistance before the fold is exactly what you want - showing the perfect balance of crisp and chew.
Way too much oregano,2025-04-18,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
Mediocre at best,2023-06-22,3,"Nothing terrible but nothing special either. The crust was okay, toppings were standard, and service was fine. It's the kind of place you go when you're in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip for."
Burned mouth on first bite,2023-06-05,2,"They served the pizza dangerously hot - barely out of the oven with no time to cool. Severely burned the roof of my mouth on the first bite, which ruined the rest of the meal and my next few days."
Way too much crust,2023-10-13,2,The edge crust (cornicione) was comically large - almost half of each slice was just bread with no toppings. This ratio of crust to actual pizza was way off and made for a disappointing experience.
Perfect NY-style slices,2024-02-10,5,"As a transplant from NYC, I've been searching for authentic NY-style pizza. This place nails it - thin, foldable slices with the right amount of chew and grease. Their plain cheese slice is perfection."
Brilliant use of fermented dough,2024-08-12,5,Their 72-hour fermented dough has incredible depth of flavor with subtle sourdough notes. The extended fermentation creates a complex web of flavors and perfect texture that you simply can't achieve with quick-rise methods.
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2024-02-04,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Magnificent flavor layering,2023-01-23,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Perfect for big groups,2023-12-31,5,"We had a party of 12 and they accommodated us perfectly. Their 20-inch shareable pizzas are great for groups, and they were happy to do half-and-half toppings to please everyone. Service was impressively coordinated."
Too much sauce,2023-08-31,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Inconsistent quality,2025-06-13,3,I've been here three times. First visit: amazing. Second: terrible. Third: just okay. Seems like it really depends on who's working that day. Wish they could maintain better quality control.
Perfect ingredient distribution,2024-05-20,5,"Every bite had the perfect combination of ingredients - no barren spots, no overwhelming clumps. The toppings were distributed with such precision it almost seemed measured. The mark of true professionals!"
Amazing Detroit-style,2023-05-26,5,"Their Detroit-style square pizza is incredible - crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior, and those corner pieces are to die for! The pepperoni cup and char perfectly. Worth the 30-minute wait."
Way too much crust,2023-02-04,2,The edge crust (cornicione) was comically large - almost half of each slice was just bread with no toppings. This ratio of crust to actual pizza was way off and made for a disappointing experience.
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2024-02-23,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Excellent beer pairing suggestions,2024-09-13,5,"Not only is their pizza excellent (try the fig and prosciutto!), but the staff is knowledgeable about their craft beer selection and can suggest the perfect pairing for whatever pizza you order."
Lackluster veggie options,2024-08-20,3,"Their vegetable toppings lacked freshness and flavor - the mushrooms were clearly canned, the peppers were soft and faded, and the onions were sparse. Disappointing for a place that advertises farm-fresh ingredients."
Crust like cardboard,2023-03-14,2,"The crust had all the flavor and texture of packing material - dry, tough, and completely devoid of character. Even the decent toppings couldn't save it. The foundation of good pizza is good dough, and this wasn't it."
Weird aftertaste,2025-06-11,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."
Too thin to be satisfying,2024-03-22,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Perfect for big groups,2024-09-09,5,"We had a party of 12 and they accommodated us perfectly. Their 20-inch shareable pizzas are great for groups, and they were happy to do half-and-half toppings to please everyone. Service was impressively coordinated."
Perfect for late-night cravings,2024-08-13,5,"Open until 3am on weekends, this place has saved many late nights. The slices are huge, they reheat them perfectly so they're crispy, and their special late-night menu items are creative and delicious."
All style no substance,2023-05-27,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."
Painfully obvious cheap ingredients,2025-03-17,2,"The pre-shredded cheese didn't melt properly, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the sausage had that distinctive processed flavor. At these prices, cutting corners on ingredients is inexcusable."
Exceptional spinach ricotta pie,2023-04-19,5,Their white pizza with spinach and ricotta is exceptional - the creamy richness of the cheese balanced by the slight bitterness of the greens. The garlic-infused olive oil base ties everything together perfectly.
Perfect thin crust,2024-09-09,5,"If you're a thin crust fan, this is your place. Cracker-thin, crispy all the way through, yet somehow still has a nice chew. Their simple cheese pizza showcases their excellent sauce - slightly sweet with a nice herb blend."
Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2024-02-21,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
Authentic Italian experience,2023-03-02,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
Inconsistent quality,2024-09-08,3,I've been here three times. First visit: amazing. Second: terrible. Third: just okay. Seems like it really depends on who's working that day. Wish they could maintain better quality control.
Too much emphasis on appearance,2024-04-01,3,"The pizza was clearly designed to look good in photos - perfect symmetry, vibrant colors, photogenic cheese pull - but the flavor was underwhelming. Style over substance for the Instagram crowd."
Outstanding breakfast pizza,2025-04-05,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
Hidden gem for vegans,2024-10-10,5,"I can't believe how good their vegan pizza is! They make their own cashew cheese that actually melts properly, and their vegetable toppings are always fresh and seasonal. Even my non-vegan friends love it."
Best white pizza ever,2023-03-07,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"
Excellent wine pairings,2023-08-21,5,"Their curated wine list is designed specifically to pair with their pizzas, and the staff is knowledgeable about suggesting the perfect match. The house red with their sausage pizza is a transcendent combination."
Pizza arrived upside-down,2023-02-12,1,Delivery driver must have taken a sharp turn because our pizza arrived completely flipped over in the box - all toppings stuck to the lid. Restaurant offered no solution other than suggesting we 'scrape it off and reassemble it.'
Undercooked in the middle,2024-12-18,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."
Toppings slide right off,2025-01-27,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Disappointed with service,2024-12-25,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."
Unmelted cheese in the center,2024-06-27,2,"The edges were fine but the center had cold, unmelted cheese - a sign the oven wasn't hot enough or the pizza wasn't cooked long enough. Basic pizza fundamentals seem to be lacking."
Incredible vodka sauce base,2025-05-11,5,"Their vodka sauce pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil is something special. The creamy, slightly spicy sauce is a perfect alternative to traditional tomato sauce. Add prosciutto for an extra flavor dimension!"
Best Hawaiian in the city,2024-01-20,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."
Perfect pepperoni placement,2023-03-16,5,"As a pepperoni perfectionist, I appreciate that they space the pepperoni so every bite gets one full piece. No bare spots or clumped areas. Shows attention to detail that elevates the whole experience."
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2024-12-19,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Outstanding variety of options,2024-04-14,5,"Their menu has something for everyone - traditional options done well, creative specialties, and customizable choices. Even have dessert pizzas that are surprisingly good (try the Nutella and banana!)."
Overpriced for what you get,2023-12-19,3,"$24 for a medium pizza with just two toppings seems excessive. The ingredients were fresh and the crust was good, but nothing justified the premium price. There are better values elsewhere in town."
Absurdly small slices,2024-09-25,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."

Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2023-09-16,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
Too expensive for pizza,2025-04-13,3,"The pizza is good, I'll give them that. But $30 for a basic large cheese pizza is highway robbery. Add toppings and you're looking at $40-50. The quality doesn't justify these premium prices."
Perfect temperature every time,2023-08-11,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
Outstanding wood-fired perfection,2023-12-06,5,The wood-fired oven gives their pizza a distinctive smoky complexity you can't get any other way. The slight char adds bitterness that balances the sweetness of the sauce perfectly. Worth seeking out for this unique flavor profile.
Perfect for late-night cravings,2025-05-11,5,"Open until 3am on weekends, this place has saved many late nights. The slices are huge, they reheat them perfectly so they're crispy, and their special late-night menu items are creative and delicious."
Excellent customer service,2025-02-15,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
False advertising on ingredients,2023-12-12,1,"Menu promised 'house-made Italian sausage' but what came on my pizza was clearly pre-formed, uniform pellets of commercial sausage. When questioned, staff admitted they don't make any ingredients in-house despite menu claims."
Cheese solidified too quickly,2024-06-14,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."

Magnificent flavor layering,2023-11-27,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Cold center burnt edges,2023-02-10,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Perfect thin crust,2024-04-08,5,"If you're a thin crust fan, this is your place. Cracker-thin, crispy all the way through, yet somehow still has a nice chew. Their simple cheese pizza showcases their excellent sauce - slightly sweet with a nice herb blend."
Best white pizza ever,2023-10-11,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"
Bland sauce needs work,2023-12-28,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
Incredible vodka sauce base,2024-05-15,5,"Their vodka sauce pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil is something special. The creamy, slightly spicy sauce is a perfect alternative to traditional tomato sauce. Add prosciutto for an extra flavor dimension!"
Outstanding breakfast pizza,2023-10-15,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
Perfect NY-style slices,2023-07-11,5,"As a transplant from NYC, I've been searching for authentic NY-style pizza. This place nails it - thin, foldable slices with the right amount of chew and grease. Their plain cheese slice is perfection."
Exceptional sauce-making technique,2023-09-29,5,"You can tell their sauce is made with properly hand-crushed tomatoes - it has that perfect texture with small chunks rather than being completely smooth. The bright flavor suggests minimal cooking, allowing the tomato quality to shine."
Excessive grease pooling,2024-05-31,2,"Had to continuously blot the pizza with napkins as pools of orange grease formed on top of the cheese with every passing minute. By the end, the napkins were completely saturated and transparent. Felt unhealthy even by pizza standards."
Perfect NY-style slices,2024-04-19,5,"As a transplant from NYC, I've been searching for authentic NY-style pizza. This place nails it - thin, foldable slices with the right amount of chew and grease. Their plain cheese slice is perfection."
Underwhelming and basic,2025-05-28,3,"Nothing particularly wrong with it, but nothing memorable either. Standard crust, standard sauce, standard toppings. In a city with so many pizza options, this place doesn't give you any reason to return."
Rude staff ruined the meal,2024-03-13,2,"The pizza itself was decent, but the counter staff was incredibly rude - sighing when I asked questions about ingredients, rushing my order, and actually rolling their eyes when I requested extra napkins."
Refrigerated dough taste,2023-06-09,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."
Perfect for dietary restrictions,2023-01-18,5,"As someone with multiple food allergies, I appreciate that they take dietary concerns seriously. Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"
Underwhelming and basic,2023-08-06,3,"Nothing particularly wrong with it, but nothing memorable either. Standard crust, standard sauce, standard toppings. In a city with so many pizza options, this place doesn't give you any reason to return."
Epic meat lovers option,2024-03-02,4,"If you're a carnivore, their 'Butcher's Block' pizza is incredible. Five different meats, all high quality - the soppressata and house-made sausage are standouts. Just be ready for a food coma afterward!"
Weird aftertaste,2025-03-12,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."
Doughy and undercooked,2024-01-08,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."

Ideal char-to-chew ratio,2024-11-01,5,The small charred bubbles on the crust add amazing flavor without dominating. They've mastered that balance between the slight bitterness of char and the natural sweetness of the dough. Technical perfection!
Outstanding variety of options,2024-07-07,5,"Their menu has something for everyone - traditional options done well, creative specialties, and customizable choices. Even have dessert pizzas that are surprisingly good (try the Nutella and banana!)."
All style no substance,2023-10-30,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."
Perfect for lunch specials,2024-10-23,4,"Their lunch deal is unbeatable - $10 for a 10-inch pizza and small salad. The pizza comes out quickly, is always fresh, and the perfect size for one person. Great place for a work lunch."
Outstanding variety of options,2024-03-14,5,"Their menu has something for everyone - traditional options done well, creative specialties, and customizable choices. Even have dessert pizzas that are surprisingly good (try the Nutella and banana!)."
Superior ingredients make the difference,2023-06-21,5,"They import their flour from Italy, use San Marzano tomatoes, and make their mozzarella in-house daily. The commitment to quality ingredients is evident in every bite - nothing is an afterthought."
Way too much oregano,2023-06-20,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
Perfect crunch factor,2024-08-07,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."
Pizza barely survived the drive home,2024-05-31,2,"Ordered takeout and by the time I got home (15 minutes), the pizza was a soggy mess. They clearly don't use appropriate packaging for takeout - no vents to release steam means the crust steams itself into sogginess."
Excellent wine pairings,2025-03-18,5,"Their curated wine list is designed specifically to pair with their pizzas, and the staff is knowledgeable about suggesting the perfect match. The house red with their sausage pizza is a transcendent combination."
Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2024-10-12,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies. The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."
Burned mouth on first bite,2023-04-14,2,"They served the pizza dangerously hot - barely out of the oven with no time to cool. Severely burned the roof of my mouth on the first bite, which ruined the rest of the meal and my next few days."
Tomato sauce tasted rancid,2025-04-30,1,"The sauce had a distinctly off flavor that suggested the tomatoes had gone bad before processing. After two bites, couldn't continue eating as the rancid notes became more pronounced. Basic food safety seems questionable."
Tiny portion sizes,2025-04-21,2,"Their 'personal' pizza is the size of a CD. For $15, I expected something that would actually satisfy my hunger. Had to order a second one, turning a quick lunch into an expensive disappointment."
Rude staff ruined the meal,2024-05-23,2,"The pizza itself was decent, but the counter staff was incredibly rude - sighing when I asked questions about ingredients, rushing my order, and actually rolling their eyes when I requested extra napkins."
Hidden gem for vegans,2023-02-25,5,"I can't believe how good their vegan pizza is! They make their own cashew cheese that actually melts properly, and their vegetable toppings are always fresh and seasonal. Even my non-vegan friends love it."
Disappointed with service,2025-03-11,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."

Perfect for watching sports,2025-04-29,4,"Great setup with TVs visible from every table, excellent pitcher specials during games, and their 'Game Day' pizza loaded with multiple meats and jalapeños is the perfect sports-watching food. Atmosphere gets lively but not obnoxious."
Perfect for picky eaters,2023-04-10,4,Their 'build your own quarter' option is genius - a large pizza divided into quadrants with different toppings. Perfect for our family where everyone wants something different. No more ordering multiple pizzas!
Phenomenal crust,2023-12-27,5,"Whatever they do to their dough is magical - it's got that perfect combination of crispy and chewy with a slight sourdough tang. I could eat their plain crust by itself, it's that good."
Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2023-08-09,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
Best white pizza ever,2023-09-07,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"

Crispy yet chewy perfection,2024-11-02,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."
Too much sauce,2024-08-18,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."

Too much cheese,2023-07-24,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Excellent customer service,2024-09-27,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
Perfect buffalo mozzarella application,2024-03-17,5,They understand that buffalo mozzarella shouldn't be cooked too long or it loses its distinctive texture and flavor. Applied in dollops after the pizza is mostly baked so it just barely melts while maintaining its creamy integrity. Technical perfection!
Masterclass in proper baking,2023-11-11,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
Perfect thin crust,2024-10-25,5,"If you're a thin crust fan, this is your place. Cracker-thin, crispy all the way through, yet somehow still has a nice chew. Their simple cheese pizza showcases their excellent sauce - slightly sweet with a nice herb blend."

Rude staff ruined the meal,2025-06-05,2,"The pizza itself was decent, but the counter staff was incredibly rude - sighing when I asked questions about ingredients, rushing my order, and actually rolling their eyes when I requested extra napkins."
Excellent for takeout,2025-06-04,4,"Their pizza travels remarkably well. Even after a 20-minute drive home, the crust was still crispy and everything was at the perfect temperature. They have their packaging technique down to a science."
Too much sauce,2025-06-23,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Amazing Detroit-style,2024-11-30,5,"Their Detroit-style square pizza is incredible - crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior, and those corner pieces are to die for! The pepperoni cup and char perfectly. Worth the 30-minute wait."
Perfect NY-style slices,2023-11-25,5,"As a transplant from NYC, I've been searching for authentic NY-style pizza. This place nails it - thin, foldable slices with the right amount of chew and grease. Their plain cheese slice is perfection."

Creative seasonal specials,2024-12-31,5,"Just had their spring special with asparagus, lemon ricotta, and prosciutto. The combination was bright, fresh, and perfect for the season. Love that they use local, seasonal ingredients."
Skimpy on toppings,2023-01-22,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."
Burned mouth on first bite,2024-01-26,2,"They served the pizza dangerously hot - barely out of the oven with no time to cool. Severely burned the roof of my mouth on the first bite, which ruined the rest of the meal and my next few days."
Brilliant seasonal rotation,2023-10-19,5,"Love that they have a rotating seasonal pizza that showcases what's fresh. The current spring offering with asparagus, green garlic, and fresh peas is bright and delicious - a perfect reflection of the season."
Inconsistent quality,2023-09-27,3,I've been here three times. First visit: amazing. Second: terrible. Third: just okay. Seems like it really depends on who's working that day. Wish they could maintain better quality control.
Late night savior,2024-08-24,4,"Open until 2am on weekends, this place has saved me many times after a night out. Their slices are huge, reheated perfectly crisp, and they have creative toppings that hit the spot when you're hungry late at night."
Cheese solidified too quickly,2023-12-03,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."

Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2025-02-18,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
Perfect crust-to-topping ratio,2024-12-17,5,"Some places overload toppings so the crust gets soggy, others are too sparse. This place gets it perfect - enough toppings to get some in every bite, but not so much that the structural integrity is compromised."
Not worth the wait,2023-11-25,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."
Innovative toppings,2024-07-10,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."
Not worth the wait,2023-04-10,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."
Perfect for large parties,2024-02-03,5,"Their party package is fantastic - multiple 18-inch pizzas with varied toppings, plenty of sides, and they were accommodating with our group of 20. Everything arrived hot and on time, and they included all the necessary paper goods."

Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"

False advertising on ingredients,2023-08-05,1,"Menu promised 'house-made Italian sausage' but what came on my pizza was clearly pre-formed, uniform pellets of commercial sausage. When questioned, staff admitted they don't make any ingredients in-house despite menu claims."
Too much garlic,2025-06-26,3,"I love garlic but this was excessive - felt like they mistook cloves for teaspoons in the recipe. My breath was lethal afterward, and the powerful flavor overwhelmed the other ingredients."
Best pizza in town,2023-01-30,5,"The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Their signature pepperoni pizza had the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, and the pepperoni curled up into little cups of deliciousness. Will definitely be back!"
Perfect for big groups,2025-04-16,5,"We had a party of 12 and they accommodated us perfectly. Their 20-inch shareable pizzas are great for groups, and they were happy to do half-and-half toppings to please everyone. Service was impressively coordinated."
Expert-level pizza folding,2023-08-06,5,Their thin-crust slices fold perfectly New York-style without cracking or losing toppings. The slight resistance before the fold is exactly what you want - showing the perfect balance of crisp and chew.
Undercooked in the middle,2024-01-24,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."
Burned mouth on first bite,2024-11-02,2,"They served the pizza dangerously hot - barely out of the oven with no time to cool. Severely burned the roof of my mouth on the first bite, which ruined the rest of the meal and my next few days."
Bland sauce needs work,2025-05-31,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
Innovative flavor combinations,2023-07-12,5,"Their 'Avant Garde' menu section features combinations I would never have thought of but somehow work perfectly. The pear, gorgonzola, walnut, and honey pizza was a revelation of sweet, salty, and savory harmony."
Too thin to be satisfying,2025-05-29,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Perfect for picky eaters,2025-05-27,4,Their 'build your own quarter' option is genius - a large pizza divided into quadrants with different toppings. Perfect for our family where everyone wants something different. No more ordering multiple pizzas!
Refrigerated dough taste,2024-09-17,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."
Perfectly crispy crust,2024-06-18,5,"However they achieve it, their crust has the perfect crispness all the way through - no soggy middle! Even the slices with lots of toppings maintain their structural integrity. Engineering marvel of pizza."
Not enough cheese,2024-05-18,3,"The sauce and crust were good, but they're stingy with cheese. You could see the sauce through the sparse cheese layer, and what was there didn't have that stretchy pull you want from a good pizza."
Expert-level pizza folding,2023-04-04,5,Their thin-crust slices fold perfectly New York-style without cracking or losing toppings. The slight resistance before the fold is exactly what you want - showing the perfect balance of crisp and chew.
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2023-11-22,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Excellent wine pairings,2023-05-14,5,"Their curated wine list is designed specifically to pair with their pizzas, and the staff is knowledgeable about suggesting the perfect match. The house red with their sausage pizza is a transcendent combination."
Skimpy on toppings,2025-06-22,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."
No flavor distinction,2023-08-16,3,Ordered two completely different specialty pizzas but they somehow tasted nearly identical. It's like they use the same base for everything and the toppings don't impart enough distinctive character.
Spicy special was too much,2023-10-08,2,Their 'Firebreather' pizza should come with a warning label. It wasn't enjoyably spicy - it was painfully hot to the point where I couldn't taste anything else. Had to throw most of it away.
Authentic Italian experience,2025-05-30,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
Crust like cardboard,2024-05-12,2,"The crust had all the flavor and texture of packing material - dry, tough, and completely devoid of character. Even the decent toppings couldn't save it. The foundation of good pizza is good dough, and this wasn't it."

Pizza arrived upside-down,2023-02-13,1,Delivery driver must have taken a sharp turn because our pizza arrived completely flipped over in the box - all toppings stuck to the lid. Restaurant offered no solution other than suggesting we 'scrape it off and reassemble it.'
Too greasy to enjoy,2023-06-17,2,"Had to literally blot my pizza with napkins, which came away completely saturated with grease. Whatever flavor might have been there was drowned in oil. Couldn't finish it as it was making me feel ill."
Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2023-10-02,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies.

Tomato sauce tasted rancid,2025-01-01,1,"The sauce had a distinctly off flavor that suggested the tomatoes had gone bad before processing. After two bites, couldn't continue eating as the rancid notes became more pronounced. Basic food safety seems questionable."
Sauce like ketchup,2024-05-05,2,"The sauce was suspiciously sweet and one-dimensional, reminiscent of ketchup rather than a proper pizza sauce. No evidence of herbs, garlic, or any complexity. Ruined what otherwise could have been a decent pizza."
Too much sauce,2023-11-13,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Excellent wine pairings,2024-09-13,5,"Their curated wine list is designed specifically to pair with their pizzas, and the staff is knowledgeable about suggesting the perfect match. The house red with their sausage pizza is a transcendent combination."

Exceptional sauce-making technique,2024-09-14,5,"You can tell their sauce is made with properly hand-crushed tomatoes - it has that perfect texture with small chunks rather than being completely smooth. The bright flavor suggests minimal cooking, allowing the tomato quality to shine."
Doughy and undercooked,2023-11-22,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Amazing Detroit-style,2024-12-30,5,"Their Detroit-style square pizza is incredible - crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior, and those corner pieces are to die for! The pepperoni cup and char perfectly. Worth the 30-minute wait."
Burned bottom raw top,2025-04-18,1,The bottom of the crust was completely black while the cheese on top wasn't fully melted. This temperature imbalance suggests serious issues with their oven management and pizza-making technique.
Exceptional spinach ricotta pie,2024-11-25,5,Their white pizza with spinach and ricotta is exceptional - the creamy richness of the cheese balanced by the slight bitterness of the greens. The garlic-infused olive oil base ties everything together perfectly.
Tasteless cheese substitute,2025-02-28,2,"Their vegan cheese option was terrible - had no meltability, a grainy texture, and tasted strongly of coconut which clashed with the tomato sauce. If you can't do vegan cheese well, better to offer cheese-free options that are properly balanced."
Doughy and undercooked,2025-04-04,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Outstanding wood-fired perfection,2023-01-14,5,The wood-fired oven gives their pizza a distinctive smoky complexity you can't get any other way. The slight char adds bitterness that balances the sweetness of the sauce perfectly. Worth seeking out for this unique flavor profile.
Exceptional spinach ricotta pie,2024-10-24,5,Their white pizza with spinach and ricotta is exceptional - the creamy richness of the cheese balanced by the slight bitterness of the greens. The garlic-infused olive oil base ties everything together perfectly.
Undercooked in the middle,2023-09-27,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."
Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2024-02-20,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
Refrigerated dough taste,2025-06-11,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."
Pizza barely survived the drive home,2023-05-29,2,"Ordered takeout and by the time I got home (15 minutes), the pizza was a soggy mess. They clearly don't use appropriate packaging for takeout - no vents to release steam means the crust steams itself into sogginess."
Too thin to be satisfying,2024-05-18,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Perfectly crispy crust,2023-07-03,5,"However they achieve it, their crust has the perfect crispness all the way through - no soggy middle! Even the slices with lots of toppings maintain their structural integrity. Engineering marvel of pizza."
Too much cheese,2024-08-23,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Cold center burnt edges,2025-01-12,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Perfect ingredient distribution,2024-10-09,5,"Every bite had the perfect combination of ingredients - no barren spots, no overwhelming clumps. The toppings were distributed with such precision it almost seemed measured. The mark of true professionals!"
Perfect thin crust,2024-01-17,5,"If you're a thin crust fan, this is your place. Cracker-thin, crispy all the way through, yet somehow still has a nice chew. Their simple cheese pizza showcases their excellent sauce - slightly sweet with a nice herb blend."
Ideal char-to-chew ratio,2023-12-21,5,The small charred bubbles on the crust add amazing flavor without dominating. They've mastered that balance between the slight bitterness of char and the natural sweetness of the dough. Technical perfection!
Perfect pepperoni placement,2024-05-20,5,"As a pepperoni perfectionist, I appreciate that they space the pepperoni so every bite gets one full piece. No bare spots or clumped areas. Shows attention to detail that elevates the whole experience."
Pizza barely survived the drive home,2024-02-26,2,"Ordered takeout and by the time I got home (15 minutes), the pizza was a soggy mess. They clearly don't use appropriate packaging for takeout - no vents to release steam means the crust steams itself into sogginess."
Tiny portion sizes,2023-10-23,2,"Their 'personal' pizza is the size of a CD. For $15, I expected something that would actually satisfy my hunger. Had to order a second one, turning a quick lunch into an expensive disappointment."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2024-07-08,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Perfect thin crust,2023-01-30,5,"If you're a thin crust fan, this is your place. Cracker-thin, crispy all the way through, yet somehow still has a nice chew. Their simple cheese pizza showcases their excellent sauce - slightly sweet with a nice herb blend."
Greasy and disappointing,2024-02-28,2,"I had high hopes based on the reviews, but my pizza was swimming in grease. The crust was undercooked in the center, and the promised 'fresh vegetables' looked and tasted canned. Such a letdown."
Outstanding wood-fired perfection,2024-03-03,5,The wood-fired oven gives their pizza a distinctive smoky complexity you can't get any other way. The slight char adds bitterness that balances the sweetness of the sauce perfectly. Worth seeking out for this unique flavor profile.
Family night favorite,2023-08-17,5,"We bring our kids here every Friday night. The staff always make them feel special, providing dough for them to play with while we wait. Their kid-sized pizzas are perfect, and the parents love the craft beer selection."
Phenomenal crust,2025-02-07,5,"Whatever they do to their dough is magical - it's got that perfect combination of crispy and chewy with a slight sourdough tang. I could eat their plain crust by itself, it's that good."
Creative seasonal specials,2023-02-17,5,"Just had their spring special with asparagus, lemon ricotta, and prosciutto. The combination was bright, fresh, and perfect for the season. Love that they use local, seasonal ingredients."
Not worth the wait,2024-06-20,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."
Creative seasonal specials,2023-10-30,5,"Just had their spring special with asparagus, lemon ricotta, and prosciutto. The combination was bright, fresh, and perfect for the season. Love that they use local, seasonal ingredients."
Too much sauce,2024-08-23,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Creative seasonal specials,2024-04-01,5,"Just had their spring special with asparagus, lemon ricotta, and prosciutto. The combination was bright, fresh, and perfect for the season. Love that they use local, seasonal ingredients."
False advertising on size,2024-10-20,2,"Their menu clearly states that a large pizza is 16 inches, but what we received couldn't have been more than 14 inches. When questioned, they claimed their menu was outdated but refused any adjustment."
Absurdly small slices,2023-10-21,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."
No flavor distinction,2023-04-08,3,Ordered two completely different specialty pizzas but they somehow tasted nearly identical. It's like they use the same base for everything and the toppings don't impart enough distinctive character.
Innovative toppings,2023-01-17,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."
Ideal char-to-chew ratio,2023-11-02,5,The small charred bubbles on the crust add amazing flavor without dominating. They've mastered that balance between the slight bitterness of char and the natural sweetness of the dough. Technical perfection!
Perfect crunch factor,2024-12-21,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."
Too salty,2024-11-26,2,"Everything I tried was oversalted - the crust, the sauce, and especially the cheese. It was like they were trying to ensure you'd order more drinks. Couldn't finish my pizza and was thirsty all night."
Excellence in simplicity,2024-03-07,5,"Their classic Margherita showcases their commitment to quality - the balance of sweet-acidic tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella, fragrant basil, and that perfectly chewy-crisp crust. Proof that simple can be sublime."
Perfect for kids' parties,2025-02-02,5,"Hosted my son's birthday here and it was fantastic. They did a dough-tossing demonstration for the kids, let them make their own mini pizzas, and the staff was incredibly patient and kind."
Perfect for large parties,2024-02-22,5,"Their party package is fantastic - multiple 18-inch pizzas with varied toppings, plenty of sides, and they were accommodating with our group of 20. Everything arrived hot and on time, and they included all the necessary paper goods."
Perfect ingredient distribution,2023-02-13,5,"Every bite had the perfect combination of ingredients - no barren spots, no overwhelming clumps. The toppings were distributed with such precision it almost seemed measured. The mark of true professionals!"
Absurdly small slices,2023-10-09,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."
Best white pizza ever,2023-09-06,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"
Expert-level pizza folding,2023-08-03,5,Their thin-crust slices fold perfectly New York-style without cracking or losing toppings. The slight resistance before the fold is exactly what you want - showing the perfect balance of crisp and chew.
Exceptional sauce-making technique,2024-06-15,5,"You can tell their sauce is made with properly hand-crushed tomatoes - it has that perfect texture with small chunks rather than being completely smooth. The bright flavor suggests minimal cooking, allowing the tomato quality to shine."
Brilliant seasonal rotation,2024-10-18,5,"Love that they have a rotating seasonal pizza that showcases what's fresh. The current spring offering with asparagus, green garlic, and fresh peas is bright and delicious - a perfect reflection of the season."
Bland sauce needs work,2023-08-14,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
Perfect crust-to-topping ratio,2024-07-25,5,"Some places overload toppings so the crust gets soggy, others are too sparse. This place gets it perfect - enough toppings to get some in every bite, but not so much that the structural integrity is compromised."
Perfect for large parties,2024-07-24,5,"Their party package is fantastic - multiple 18-inch pizzas with varied toppings, plenty of sides, and they were accommodating with our group of 20. Everything arrived hot and on time, and they included all the necessary paper goods."
Tomato sauce tasted rancid,2024-01-30,1,"The sauce had a distinctly off flavor that suggested the tomatoes had gone bad before processing. After two bites, couldn't continue eating as the rancid notes became more pronounced. Basic food safety seems questionable."
Cold center burnt edges,2024-12-12,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Burnt crust ruins it,2024-06-02,2,"They claim 'char' is part of the Neapolitan experience, but there's a difference between char and burnt. The entire bottom of my pizza was black and bitter. Scraping it off meant losing half the crust."
Cheese solidified too quickly,2024-11-28,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Not enough cheese,2023-08-02,3,"The sauce and crust were good, but they're stingy with cheese. You could see the sauce through the sparse cheese layer, and what was there didn't have that stretchy pull you want from a good pizza."
Outstanding breakfast pizza,2024-08-11,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
Perfect textural contrast,2024-11-20,5,"The contrast between the crisp bottom, the tender interior crumb, the gooey cheese, and the slight resistance of the toppings creates a textural symphony. Each bite is interesting and satisfying in a different way."
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2024-05-12,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
Too much garlic,2024-05-06,3,"I love garlic but this was excessive - felt like they mistook cloves for teaspoons in the recipe. My breath was lethal afterward, and the powerful flavor overwhelmed the other ingredients."
Spicy special was too much,2024-11-21,2,Their 'Firebreather' pizza should come with a warning label. It wasn't enjoyably spicy - it was painfully hot to the point where I couldn't taste anything else. Had to throw most of it away.
Best Hawaiian in the city,2025-03-03,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."
Undercooked in the middle,2023-09-02,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."
Perfect temperature every time,2023-05-25,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
Innovative toppings,2025-01-27,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."
Too much emphasis on appearance,2024-02-12,3,"The pizza was clearly designed to look good in photos - perfect symmetry, vibrant colors, photogenic cheese pull - but the flavor was underwhelming. Style over substance for the Instagram crowd."
Toppings slide right off,2025-02-15,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.

Expert-level pizza folding,2023-02-09,5,Their thin-crust slices fold perfectly New York-style without cracking or losing toppings. The slight resistance before the fold is exactly what you want - showing the perfect balance of crisp and chew.
Masterful use of olive oil,2024-08-23,5,"The drizzle of high-quality olive oil they add just before serving makes all the difference - adds richness, enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, and adds a wonderful aromatic element. Simple but transformative."
Great gluten-free option,2023-07-25,4,"As someone with celiac disease, finding good gluten-free pizza is a challenge. Their cauliflower crust was one of the best I've had - doesn't fall apart and has a nice flavor. Toppings were generous too."
Best Hawaiian in the city,2024-03-28,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."
Painfully obvious cheap ingredients,2023-03-14,2,"The pre-shredded cheese didn't melt properly, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the sausage had that distinctive processed flavor. At these prices, cutting corners on ingredients is inexcusable."
Spicy special was too much,2023-04-03,2,Their 'Firebreather' pizza should come with a warning label. It wasn't enjoyably spicy - it was painfully hot to the point where I couldn't taste anything else. Had to throw most of it away.
All style no substance,2024-07-13,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."
Burnt crust ruins it,2023-06-01,2,"They claim 'char' is part of the Neapolitan experience, but there's a difference between char and burnt. The entire bottom of my pizza was black and bitter. Scraping it off meant losing half the crust."
Tasteless cheese substitute,2025-05-08,2,"Their vegan cheese option was terrible - had no meltability, a grainy texture, and tasted strongly of coconut which clashed with the tomato sauce. If you can't do vegan cheese well, better to offer cheese-free options that are properly balanced."
Way too much oregano,2023-08-30,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
Amazing Detroit-style,2023-01-05,5,"Their Detroit-style square pizza is incredible - crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior, and those corner pieces are to die for! The pepperoni cup and char perfectly. Worth the 30-minute wait."
Sloppy presentation,2023-10-07,3,"The pizza looked like it had been assembled in a hurry - toppings haphazardly thrown on, cheese unevenly distributed, and the cutting was so uneven that some slices were twice the size of others. Taste was okay, but appearance matters too."
Too noisy for conversation,2023-03-05,3,The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option.

Doughy and undercooked,2025-06-02,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Masterful use of olive oil,2024-01-21,5,"The drizzle of high-quality olive oil they add just before serving makes all the difference - adds richness, enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, and adds a wonderful aromatic element. Simple but transformative."
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2024-05-17,5,They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!
Not worth the wait,2024-10-23,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."

Perfect for lunch specials,2024-09-22,4,"Their lunch deal is unbeatable - $10 for a 10-inch pizza and small salad. The pizza comes out quickly, is always fresh, and the perfect size for one person. Great place for a work lunch."
Cheese solidified too quickly,2023-11-08,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."

Outstanding wood-fired perfection,2024-03-08,5,The wood-fired oven gives their pizza a distinctive smoky complexity you can't get any other way. The slight char adds bitterness that balances the sweetness of the sauce perfectly. Worth seeking out for this unique flavor profile.
Mediocre at best,2024-10-05,3,"Nothing terrible but nothing special either. The crust was okay, toppings were standard, and service was fine. It's the kind of place you go when you're in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip for."
Too noisy for conversation,2025-04-22,3,The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option.

Unmelted cheese in the center,2025-05-13,2,"The edges were fine but the center had cold, unmelted cheese - a sign the oven wasn't hot enough or the pizza wasn't cooked long enough. Basic pizza fundamentals seem to be lacking."
Terrible delivery experience,2024-02-29,1,"Ordered for Valentine's Day and regretted it. Pizza took 2 hours to arrive, was cold, and had the wrong toppings. Called the restaurant and they seemed completely unconcerned. Never again."
Too expensive for pizza,2023-12-10,3,"The pizza is good, I'll give them that. But $30 for a basic large cheese pizza is highway robbery. Add toppings and you're looking at $40-50. The quality doesn't justify these premium prices."
Perfect buffalo mozzarella application,2024-11-05,5,They understand that buffalo mozzarella shouldn't be cooked too long or it loses its distinctive texture and flavor. Applied in dollops after the pizza is mostly baked so it just barely melts while maintaining its creamy integrity. Technical perfection!
Pizza arrived upside-down,2024-11-25,1,Delivery driver must have taken a sharp turn because our pizza arrived completely flipped over in the box - all toppings stuck to the lid. Restaurant offered no solution other than suggesting we 'scrape it off and reassemble it.'
Perfect for kids' parties,2024-06-04,5,"Hosted my son's birthday here and it was fantastic. They did a dough-tossing demonstration for the kids, let them make their own mini pizzas, and the staff was incredibly patient and kind."
Excessive grease pooling,2023-06-08,2,"Had to continuously blot the pizza with napkins as pools of orange grease formed on top of the cheese with every passing minute. By the end, the napkins were completely saturated and transparent. Felt unhealthy even by pizza standards."
Masterclass in proper baking,2025-06-06,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2024-09-25,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Weird aftertaste,2024-09-06,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."
Perfect for kids' parties,2023-09-22,5,"Hosted my son's birthday here and it was fantastic. They did a dough-tossing demonstration for the kids, let them make their own mini pizzas, and the staff was incredibly patient and kind."
Tough leathery crust,2024-08-29,2,"The crust was so tough I almost couldn't bite through it - like trying to eat leather. The edges were particularly problematic, had to tear pieces off with significant effort. Completely lacks the pleasant chewiness good pizza should have."
Inconsistent quality,2024-10-09,3,I've been here three times. First visit: amazing. Second: terrible. Third: just okay. Seems like it really depends on who's working that day. Wish they could maintain better quality control.
False advertising on size,2025-06-29,2,"Their menu clearly states that a large pizza is 16 inches, but what we received couldn't have been more than 14 inches. When questioned, they claimed their menu was outdated but refused any adjustment."

Exceptional spinach ricotta pie,2023-08-20,5,Their white pizza with spinach and ricotta is exceptional - the creamy richness of the cheese balanced by the slight bitterness of the greens. The garlic-infused olive oil base ties everything together perfectly.
Excellent for takeout,2023-04-21,4,"Their pizza travels remarkably well. Even after a 20-minute drive home, the crust was still crispy and everything was at the perfect temperature. They have their packaging technique down to a science."
New owners ruined it,2024-01-18,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."
Perfect for big groups,2024-09-13,5,"We had a party of 12 and they accommodated us perfectly. Their 20-inch shareable pizzas are great for groups, and they were happy to do half-and-half toppings to please everyone. Service was impressively coordinated."
Painfully obvious cheap ingredients,2023-03-02,2,"The pre-shredded cheese didn't melt properly, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the sausage had that distinctive processed flavor. At these prices, cutting corners on ingredients is inexcusable."

Overpriced for what you get,2024-03-19,3,"$24 for a medium pizza with just two toppings seems excessive. The ingredients were fresh and the crust was good, but nothing justified the premium price. There are better values elsewhere in town."
Perfect for watching sports,2025-04-11,4,"Great setup with TVs visible from every table, excellent pitcher specials during games, and their 'Game Day' pizza loaded with multiple meats and jalapeños is the perfect sports-watching food. Atmosphere gets lively but not obnoxious."

Doughy and undercooked,2023-08-14,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Skimpy on toppings,2025-06-09,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."
Painfully obvious cheap ingredients,2023-11-01,2,"The pre-shredded cheese didn't melt properly, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the sausage had that distinctive processed flavor. At these prices, cutting corners on ingredients is inexcusable."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2025-02-11,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Cold center burnt edges,2023-10-13,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Dirty restaurant,2023-08-20,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."
Absurdly small slices,2025-04-16,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."
Too greasy to enjoy,2025-03-18,2,"Had to literally blot my pizza with napkins, which came away completely saturated with grease. Whatever flavor might have been there was drowned in oil. Couldn't finish it as it was making me feel ill."
Brilliant seasonal rotation,2023-03-14,5,"Love that they have a rotating seasonal pizza that showcases what's fresh. The current spring offering with asparagus, green garlic, and fresh peas is bright and delicious - a perfect reflection of the season."
Tomato sauce tasted rancid,2025-06-19,1,"The sauce had a distinctly off flavor that suggested the tomatoes had gone bad before processing. After two bites, couldn't continue eating as the rancid notes became more pronounced. Basic food safety seems questionable."
Pizza barely survived the drive home,2025-04-20,2,"Ordered takeout and by the time I got home (15 minutes), the pizza was a soggy mess. They clearly don't use appropriate packaging for takeout - no vents to release steam means the crust steams itself into sogginess."
Late night savior,2025-04-17,4,"Open until 2am on weekends, this place has saved me many times after a night out. Their slices are huge, reheated perfectly crisp, and they have creative toppings that hit the spot when you're hungry late at night."
Excellent attention to cooking time,2024-09-25,5,They nail the cooking time perfectly - pulling the pizza from the oven at exactly the right moment when the cheese is fully melted and bubbling but not yet browned. Shows expertise and attention to detail.
Superior ingredients make the difference,2023-11-19,5,"They import their flour from Italy, use San Marzano tomatoes, and make their mozzarella in-house daily. The commitment to quality ingredients is evident in every bite - nothing is an afterthought."
Perfect for picky eaters,2024-01-15,4,Their 'build your own quarter' option is genius - a large pizza divided into quadrants with different toppings. Perfect for our family where everyone wants something different. No more ordering multiple pizzas!

Perfect for picky eaters,2023-05-16,4,Their 'build your own quarter' option is genius - a large pizza divided into quadrants with different toppings. Perfect for our family where everyone wants something different. No more ordering multiple pizzas!
False advertising on size,2025-01-11,2,"Their menu clearly states that a large pizza is 16 inches, but what we received couldn't have been more than 14 inches. When questioned, they claimed their menu was outdated but refused any adjustment."
Too thin to be satisfying,2025-06-16,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Brilliant use of fermented dough,2024-05-26,5,Their 72-hour fermented dough has incredible depth of flavor with subtle sourdough notes. The extended fermentation creates a complex web of flavors and perfect texture that you simply can't achieve with quick-rise methods.
Overpriced for what you get,2025-02-17,3,"$24 for a medium pizza with just two toppings seems excessive. The ingredients were fresh and the crust was good, but nothing justified the premium price. There are better values elsewhere in town."
Too salty,2024-01-12,2,"Everything I tried was oversalted - the crust, the sauce, and especially the cheese. It was like they were trying to ensure you'd order more drinks. Couldn't finish my pizza and was thirsty all night."
Lackluster veggie options,2025-04-17,3,"Their vegetable toppings lacked freshness and flavor - the mushrooms were clearly canned, the peppers were soft and faded, and the onions were sparse. Disappointing for a place that advertises farm-fresh ingredients."
Refrigerated dough taste,2024-01-06,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."
Tasteless cheese substitute,2025-02-26,2,"Their vegan cheese option was terrible - had no meltability, a grainy texture, and tasted strongly of coconut which clashed with the tomato sauce. If you can't do vegan cheese well, better to offer cheese-free options that are properly balanced."
Perfect for dietary restrictions,2025-03-13,5,"As someone with multiple food allergies, I appreciate that they take dietary concerns seriously. Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"
Toppings slide right off,2025-05-15,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Weird aftertaste,2024-10-05,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."
Best Hawaiian in the city,2023-01-29,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."
Burned bottom raw top,2024-11-21,1,The bottom of the crust was completely black while the cheese on top wasn't fully melted. This temperature imbalance suggests serious issues with their oven management and pizza-making technique.
Incredible vodka sauce base,2023-09-17,5,"Their vodka sauce pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil is something special. The creamy, slightly spicy sauce is a perfect alternative to traditional tomato sauce. Add prosciutto for an extra flavor dimension!"
Inconsistent quality,2024-04-24,3,I've been here three times. First visit: amazing. Second: terrible. Third: just okay. Seems like it really depends on who's working that day. Wish they could maintain better quality control.
Too much emphasis on appearance,2024-08-18,3,"The pizza was clearly designed to look good in photos - perfect symmetry, vibrant colors, photogenic cheese pull - but the flavor was underwhelming. Style over substance for the Instagram crowd."
Dirty restaurant,2023-08-30,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."
Disappointed with service,2023-08-02,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."
Masterclass in proper baking,2025-03-20,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
Late night savior,2024-12-23,4,"Open until 2am on weekends, this place has saved me many times after a night out. Their slices are huge, reheated perfectly crisp, and they have creative toppings that hit the spot when you're hungry late at night."
Righteous ranch drizzle,2023-07-04,5,Their house-made ranch drizzle takes their pizzas to another level. It's not your typical ranch - has hints of dill and garlic with a perfect consistency that adds creaminess without making things soggy.
Pizza arrived upside-down,2023-06-12,1,Delivery driver must have taken a sharp turn because our pizza arrived completely flipped over in the box - all toppings stuck to the lid. Restaurant offered no solution other than suggesting we 'scrape it off and reassemble it.'
Stale-tasting crust,2023-05-21,2,"The crust had a stale, almost cardboard-like quality that suggests either old dough or old flour. Fresh ingredients on top couldn't compensate for the foundation being off."
Sloppy presentation,2024-02-05,3,"The pizza looked like it had been assembled in a hurry - toppings haphazardly thrown on, cheese unevenly distributed, and the cutting was so uneven that some slices were twice the size of others. Taste was okay, but appearance matters too."
Expert-level pizza folding,2023-07-22,5,Their thin-crust slices fold perfectly New York-style without cracking or losing toppings. The slight resistance before the fold is exactly what you want - showing the perfect balance of crisp and chew.
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2025-01-10,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."
Ideal char-to-chew ratio,2025-01-23,5,The small charred bubbles on the crust add amazing flavor without dominating. They've mastered that balance between the slight bitterness of char and the natural sweetness of the dough. Technical perfection!
Tiny portion sizes,2024-03-16,2,"Their 'personal' pizza is the size of a CD. For $15, I expected something that would actually satisfy my hunger. Had to order a second one, turning a quick lunch into an expensive disappointment."

Too noisy for conversation,2025-02-05,3,The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option.
Exceptional spinach ricotta pie,2024-06-16,5,Their white pizza with spinach and ricotta is exceptional - the creamy richness of the cheese balanced by the slight bitterness of the greens. The garlic-infused olive oil base ties everything together perfectly.
Superior ingredients make the difference,2025-01-18,5,"They import their flour from Italy, use San Marzano tomatoes, and make their mozzarella in-house daily. The commitment to quality ingredients is evident in every bite - nothing is an afterthought."
Masterful use of olive oil,2023-06-22,5,"The drizzle of high-quality olive oil they add just before serving makes all the difference - adds richness, enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, and adds a wonderful aromatic element. Simple but transformative."
Tiny portion sizes,2025-01-11,2,"Their 'personal' pizza is the size of a CD. For $15, I expected something that would actually satisfy my hunger. Had to order a second one, turning a quick lunch into an expensive disappointment."
Incredible vodka sauce base,2025-06-09,5,"Their vodka sauce pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil is something special. The creamy, slightly spicy sauce is a perfect alternative to traditional tomato sauce. Add prosciutto for an extra flavor dimension!"
Perfect NY-style slices,2023-03-01,5,"As a transplant from NYC, I've been searching for authentic NY-style pizza. This place nails it - thin, foldable slices with the right amount of chew and grease. Their plain cheese slice is perfection."
Too much cheese,2025-05-03,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Creative seasonal specials,2024-12-05,5,"Just had their spring special with asparagus, lemon ricotta, and prosciutto. The combination was bright, fresh, and perfect for the season. Love that they use local, seasonal ingredients."
Excellent customer service,2024-04-22,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
Great gluten-free option,2023-12-12,4,"As someone with celiac disease, finding good gluten-free pizza is a challenge. Their cauliflower crust was one of the best I've had - doesn't fall apart and has a nice flavor. Toppings were generous too."
Too much cornmeal,2024-04-23,3,"They use cornmeal on the bottom of the crust to prevent sticking, which is standard, but they use so much that it's like eating pizza on a sandpaper surface. Gritty texture overwhelms the experience."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2025-06-28,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
False advertising on ingredients,2024-01-28,1,"Menu promised 'house-made Italian sausage' but what came on my pizza was clearly pre-formed, uniform pellets of commercial sausage. When questioned, staff admitted they don't make any ingredients in-house despite menu claims."
Toppings slide right off,2024-08-19,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Tiny portion sizes,2024-02-28,2,"Their 'personal' pizza is the size of a CD. For $15, I expected something that would actually satisfy my hunger. Had to order a second one, turning a quick lunch into an expensive disappointment."

Incredible vodka sauce base,2024-03-17,5,"Their vodka sauce pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil is something special. The creamy, slightly spicy sauce is a perfect alternative to traditional tomato sauce. Add prosciutto for an extra flavor dimension!"
Too much sauce,2024-03-13,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Mediocre at best,2024-03-15,3,"Nothing terrible but nothing special either. The crust was okay, toppings were standard, and service was fine. It's the kind of place you go when you're in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip for."
Outstanding breakfast pizza,2023-02-25,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
Greasy and disappointing,2025-05-06,2,"I had high hopes based on the reviews, but my pizza was swimming in grease. The crust was undercooked in the center, and the promised 'fresh vegetables' looked and tasted canned. Such a letdown."
Too noisy for conversation,2025-04-24,3,The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option.
Too salty,2025-04-09,2,"Everything I tried was oversalted - the crust, the sauce, and especially the cheese. It was like they were trying to ensure you'd order more drinks. Couldn't finish my pizza and was thirsty all night."
Perfect for lunch specials,2023-10-26,4,"Their lunch deal is unbeatable - $10 for a 10-inch pizza and small salad. The pizza comes out quickly, is always fresh, and the perfect size for one person. Great place for a work lunch."
Terrible delivery experience,2024-03-20,1,"Ordered for Valentine's Day and regretted it. Pizza took 2 hours to arrive, was cold, and had the wrong toppings. Called the restaurant and they seemed completely unconcerned. Never again."
Unmelted cheese in the center,2024-08-13,2,"The edges were fine but the center had cold, unmelted cheese - a sign the oven wasn't hot enough or the pizza wasn't cooked long enough. Basic pizza fundamentals seem to be lacking."
Authentic Italian experience,2025-05-24,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
Dirty restaurant,2024-06-28,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."
Unmelted cheese in the center,2025-03-23,2,"The edges were fine but the center had cold, unmelted cheese - a sign the oven wasn't hot enough or the pizza wasn't cooked long enough. Basic pizza fundamentals seem to be lacking."
Spicy special was too much,2024-10-10,2,Their 'Firebreather' pizza should come with a warning label. It wasn't enjoyably spicy - it was painfully hot to the point where I couldn't taste anything else. Had to throw most of it away.
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2025-01-14,5,They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!
Perfect balance of flavors,2023-05-03,5,"Their 'Mediterranean' pizza has the perfect balance of flavors - the briny olives, tangy feta, fresh tomatoes, and herb-infused olive oil all complement each other without any one element overwhelming the others."
All style no substance,2023-03-13,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."
Excellent Chicago deep dish,2023-09-01,5,"Hard to find authentic Chicago-style pizza in this area, but they nail it. The buttery, flaky crust, the layering of cheese under the sauce, the chunky tomato topping - all perfect. Worth the 45-minute cook time."
Pizza arrived upside-down,2024-04-27,1,Delivery driver must have taken a sharp turn because our pizza arrived completely flipped over in the box - all toppings stuck to the lid. Restaurant offered no solution other than suggesting we 'scrape it off and reassemble it.'
Burnt crust ruins it,2025-06-28,2,"They claim 'char' is part of the Neapolitan experience, but there's a difference between char and burnt. The entire bottom of my pizza was black and bitter. Scraping it off meant losing half the crust."
Too much cornmeal,2023-02-28,3,"They use cornmeal on the bottom of the crust to prevent sticking, which is standard, but they use so much that it's like eating pizza on a sandpaper surface. Gritty texture overwhelms the experience."

Brilliant use of fermented dough,2024-07-21,5,Their 72-hour fermented dough has incredible depth of flavor with subtle sourdough notes. The extended fermentation creates a complex web of flavors and perfect texture that you simply can't achieve with quick-rise methods.

Perfect ingredient distribution,2024-08-28,5,"Every bite had the perfect combination of ingredients - no barren spots, no overwhelming clumps. The toppings were distributed with such precision it almost seemed measured. The mark of true professionals!"
Righteous ranch drizzle,2024-10-07,5,Their house-made ranch drizzle takes their pizzas to another level. It's not your typical ranch - has hints of dill and garlic with a perfect consistency that adds creaminess without making things soggy.
Too much garlic,2023-12-05,3,"I love garlic but this was excessive - felt like they mistook cloves for teaspoons in the recipe. My breath was lethal afterward, and the powerful flavor overwhelmed the other ingredients."
All style no substance,2024-09-13,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."
Inconsistent quality,2024-05-01,3,I've been here three times. First visit: amazing. Second: terrible. Third: just okay. Seems like it really depends on who's working that day. Wish they could maintain better quality control.

Perfect for big groups,2025-01-22,5,"We had a party of 12 and they accommodated us perfectly. Their 20-inch shareable pizzas are great for groups, and they were happy to do half-and-half toppings to please everyone. Service was impressively coordinated."
Too much cornmeal,2024-06-22,3,"They use cornmeal on the bottom of the crust to prevent sticking, which is standard, but they use so much that it's like eating pizza on a sandpaper surface. Gritty texture overwhelms the experience."
Late night savior,2024-10-31,4,"Open until 2am on weekends, this place has saved me many times after a night out. Their slices are huge, reheated perfectly crisp, and they have creative toppings that hit the spot when you're hungry late at night."
Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2025-03-01,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
Cold center burnt edges,2024-11-30,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Excellent attention to cooking time,2023-03-29,5,They nail the cooking time perfectly - pulling the pizza from the oven at exactly the right moment when the cheese is fully melted and bubbling but not yet browned. Shows expertise and attention to detail.
Perfect for late-night cravings,2024-10-08,5,"Open until 3am on weekends, this place has saved many late nights. The slices are huge, they reheat them perfectly so they're crispy, and their special late-night menu items are creative and delicious."
Undercooked in the middle,2023-11-07,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."
Painfully obvious cheap ingredients,2023-08-12,2,"The pre-shredded cheese didn't melt properly, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the sausage had that distinctive processed flavor. At these prices, cutting corners on ingredients is inexcusable."
Exceptional sauce-making technique,2024-10-18,5,"You can tell their sauce is made with properly hand-crushed tomatoes - it has that perfect texture with small chunks rather than being completely smooth. The bright flavor suggests minimal cooking, allowing the tomato quality to shine."
Dirty restaurant,2025-05-16,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."

Perfect for watching sports,2024-05-24,4,"Great setup with TVs visible from every table, excellent pitcher specials during games, and their 'Game Day' pizza loaded with multiple meats and jalapeños is the perfect sports-watching food. Atmosphere gets lively but not obnoxious."
Skimpy on toppings,2024-08-03,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."
New owners ruined it,2024-10-09,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."
Too much salt in the dough,2023-06-10,2,The crust was so salty it was almost inedible - overwhelmed all the other flavors and left me incredibly thirsty afterward. A heavy hand with salt ruined what could have been a good pizza.
Terrible delivery experience,2024-07-06,1,"Ordered for Valentine's Day and regretted it. Pizza took 2 hours to arrive, was cold, and had the wrong toppings. Called the restaurant and they seemed completely unconcerned. Never again."

Incredible vodka sauce base,2023-02-02,5,"Their vodka sauce pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil is something special. The creamy, slightly spicy sauce is a perfect alternative to traditional tomato sauce. Add prosciutto for an extra flavor dimension!"
Perfect for kids' parties,2024-09-11,5,"Hosted my son's birthday here and it was fantastic. They did a dough-tossing demonstration for the kids, let them make their own mini pizzas, and the staff was incredibly patient and kind."
Perfect temperature every time,2024-12-04,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
Phenomenal crust,2024-10-22,5,"Whatever they do to their dough is magical - it's got that perfect combination of crispy and chewy with a slight sourdough tang. I could eat their plain crust by itself, it's that good."
Painfully obvious cheap ingredients,2024-12-27,2,"The pre-shredded cheese didn't melt properly, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the sausage had that distinctive processed flavor. At these prices, cutting corners on ingredients is inexcusable."

Perfect thin crust,2023-01-20,5,"If you're a thin crust fan, this is your place. Cracker-thin, crispy all the way through, yet somehow still has a nice chew. Their simple cheese pizza showcases their excellent sauce - slightly sweet with a nice herb blend."
Late night savior,2023-12-22,4,"Open until 2am on weekends, this place has saved me many times after a night out. Their slices are huge, reheated perfectly crisp, and they have creative toppings that hit the spot when you're hungry late at night."
Perfect ingredient distribution,2023-03-13,5,"Every bite had the perfect combination of ingredients - no barren spots, no overwhelming clumps. The toppings were distributed with such precision it almost seemed measured. The mark of true professionals!"
Burned mouth on first bite,2023-02-18,2,"They served the pizza dangerously hot - barely out of the oven with no time to cool. Severely burned the roof of my mouth on the first bite, which ruined the rest of the meal and my next few days."
Supreme quality control,2023-05-01,5,"Visited multiple times and the consistency is impressive - every pizza comes out identical to the last one, with the same excellent quality. Shows serious commitment to training and standards that's rare in casual dining."
Too salty,2023-01-14,2,"Everything I tried was oversalted - the crust, the sauce, and especially the cheese. It was like they were trying to ensure you'd order more drinks. Couldn't finish my pizza and was thirsty all night."
Perfect crunch factor,2025-02-07,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."
Perfect temperature every time,2025-01-29,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
Perfect for lunch specials,2023-09-09,4,"Their lunch deal is unbeatable - $10 for a 10-inch pizza and small salad. The pizza comes out quickly, is always fresh, and the perfect size for one person. Great place for a work lunch."
Undercooked in the middle,2025-02-23,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."
Creative seasonal specials,2024-07-24,5,"Just had their spring special with asparagus, lemon ricotta, and prosciutto. The combination was bright, fresh, and perfect for the season. Love that they use local, seasonal ingredients."
Perfect NY-style slices,2025-02-16,5,"As a transplant from NYC, I've been searching for authentic NY-style pizza. This place nails it - thin, foldable slices with the right amount of chew and grease. Their plain cheese slice is perfection."
Too much garlic,2024-06-13,3,"I love garlic but this was excessive - felt like they mistook cloves for teaspoons in the recipe. My breath was lethal afterward, and the powerful flavor overwhelmed the other ingredients."
Too expensive for pizza,2023-05-08,3,"The pizza is good, I'll give them that. But $30 for a basic large cheese pizza is highway robbery. Add toppings and you're looking at $40-50. The quality doesn't justify these premium prices."
All style no substance,2023-09-16,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."
Perfect crust-to-topping ratio,2024-10-06,5,"Some places overload toppings so the crust gets soggy, others are too sparse. This place gets it perfect - enough toppings to get some in every bite, but not so much that the structural integrity is compromised."
Lackluster veggie options,2025-05-13,3,"Their vegetable toppings lacked freshness and flavor - the mushrooms were clearly canned, the peppers were soft and faded, and the onions were sparse. Disappointing for a place that advertises farm-fresh ingredients."
Exceptional spinach ricotta pie,2023-05-19,5,Their white pizza with spinach and ricotta is exceptional - the creamy richness of the cheese balanced by the slight bitterness of the greens. The garlic-infused olive oil base ties everything together perfectly.
Disappointed with service,2023-01-12,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."
Too much sauce,2025-01-24,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Absurdly small slices,2025-05-14,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."
Excellent wine pairings,2023-08-06,5,"Their curated wine list is designed specifically to pair with their pizzas, and the staff is knowledgeable about suggesting the perfect match. The house red with their sausage pizza is a transcendent combination."
Cold center burnt edges,2024-08-02,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Too much emphasis on appearance,2025-02-12,3,"The pizza was clearly designed to look good in photos - perfect symmetry, vibrant colors, photogenic cheese pull - but the flavor was underwhelming. Style over substance for the Instagram crowd."
Brilliant seasonal rotation,2025-06-18,5,"Love that they have a rotating seasonal pizza that showcases what's fresh. The current spring offering with asparagus, green garlic, and fresh peas is bright and delicious - a perfect reflection of the season."
Hidden gem for vegans,2024-02-24,5,"I can't believe how good their vegan pizza is! They make their own cashew cheese that actually melts properly, and their vegetable toppings are always fresh and seasonal. Even my non-vegan friends love it."
Innovative toppings,2025-04-05,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."
Too thin to be satisfying,2023-03-26,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Too expensive for pizza,2023-10-31,3,"The pizza is good, I'll give them that. But $30 for a basic large cheese pizza is highway robbery. Add toppings and you're looking at $40-50. The quality doesn't justify these premium prices."
Excellent customer service,2025-06-17,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
New owners ruined it,2024-05-22,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."
Excellent wine pairings,2024-11-01,5,"Their curated wine list is designed specifically to pair with their pizzas, and the staff is knowledgeable about suggesting the perfect match. The house red with their sausage pizza is a transcendent combination."
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2024-06-22,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
Perfect balance of flavors,2023-11-20,5,"Their 'Mediterranean' pizza has the perfect balance of flavors - the briny olives, tangy feta, fresh tomatoes, and herb-infused olive oil all complement each other without any one element overwhelming the others."
Perfect thin crust,2024-09-17,5,"If you're a thin crust fan, this is your place. Cracker-thin, crispy all the way through, yet somehow still has a nice chew. Their simple cheese pizza showcases their excellent sauce - slightly sweet with a nice herb blend."
Crispy yet chewy perfection,2023-05-27,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."
Doughy and undercooked,2023-04-22,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Excellent customer service,2024-01-17,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
Perfect for picky eaters,2023-05-25,4,Their 'build your own quarter' option is genius - a large pizza divided into quadrants with different toppings. Perfect for our family where everyone wants something different. No more ordering multiple pizzas!
Too noisy for conversation,2025-03-22,3,The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option.
Perfect ingredient distribution,2025-04-06,5,"Every bite had the perfect combination of ingredients - no barren spots, no overwhelming clumps. The toppings were distributed with such precision it almost seemed measured. The mark of true professionals!"
Too much sauce,2024-12-17,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Tomato sauce tasted rancid,2024-06-21,1,"The sauce had a distinctly off flavor that suggested the tomatoes had gone bad before processing. After two bites, couldn't continue eating as the rancid notes became more pronounced. Basic food safety seems questionable."
Perfect pepperoni placement,2025-06-06,5,"As a pepperoni perfectionist, I appreciate that they space the pepperoni so every bite gets one full piece. No bare spots or clumped areas. Shows attention to detail that elevates the whole experience."
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2024-06-03,5,They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!
New owners ruined it,2023-02-04,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."
Outstanding wood-fired perfection,2023-08-20,5,The wood-fired oven gives their pizza a distinctive smoky complexity you can't get any other way. The slight char adds bitterness that balances the sweetness of the sauce perfectly. Worth seeking out for this unique flavor profile.

Righteous ranch drizzle,2023-01-02,5,Their house-made ranch drizzle takes their pizzas to another level. It's not your typical ranch - has hints of dill and garlic with a perfect consistency that adds creaminess without making things soggy.
Outstanding wood-fired perfection,2023-04-22,5,The wood-fired oven gives their pizza a distinctive smoky complexity you can't get any other way. The slight char adds bitterness that balances the sweetness of the sauce perfectly. Worth seeking out for this unique flavor profile.
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2023-11-22,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."
Perfect for late-night cravings,2024-03-05,5,"Open until 3am on weekends, this place has saved many late nights. The slices are huge, they reheat them perfectly so they're crispy, and their special late-night menu items are creative and delicious."
Magnificent flavor layering,2023-12-08,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Excellence in simplicity,2024-03-01,5,"Their classic Margherita showcases their commitment to quality - the balance of sweet-acidic tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella, fragrant basil, and that perfectly chewy-crisp crust. Proof that simple can be sublime."
Best Hawaiian in the city,2024-10-29,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."
Excellent wine pairings,2025-05-20,5,"Their curated wine list is designed specifically to pair with their pizzas, and the staff is knowledgeable about suggesting the perfect match. The house red with their sausage pizza is a transcendent combination."
Weird aftertaste,2023-04-15,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."

Too salty,2023-01-16,2,"Everything I tried was oversalted - the crust, the sauce, and especially the cheese. It was like they were trying to ensure you'd order more drinks. Couldn't finish my pizza and was thirsty all night."
False advertising on size,2025-01-10,2,"Their menu clearly states that a large pizza is 16 inches, but what we received couldn't have been more than 14 inches. When questioned, they claimed their menu was outdated but refused any adjustment."
No flavor distinction,2023-07-09,3,Ordered two completely different specialty pizzas but they somehow tasted nearly identical. It's like they use the same base for everything and the toppings don't impart enough distinctive character.
Sauce like ketchup,2023-08-23,2,"The sauce was suspiciously sweet and one-dimensional, reminiscent of ketchup rather than a proper pizza sauce. No evidence of herbs, garlic, or any complexity. Ruined what otherwise could have been a decent pizza."
Masterful use of olive oil,2025-05-26,5,"The drizzle of high-quality olive oil they add just before serving makes all the difference - adds richness, enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, and adds a wonderful aromatic element. Simple but transformative."
Excellent attention to cooking time,2023-09-26,5,They nail the cooking time perfectly - pulling the pizza from the oven at exactly the right moment when the cheese is fully melted and bubbling but not yet browned. Shows expertise and attention to detail.
Outstanding breakfast pizza,2024-03-13,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
Absurdly small slices,2023-02-07,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."
Bland sauce needs work,2023-02-16,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
Rude staff ruined the meal,2023-03-03,2,"The pizza itself was decent, but the counter staff was incredibly rude - sighing when I asked questions about ingredients, rushing my order, and actually rolling their eyes when I requested extra napkins."
Amazing Detroit-style,2024-11-21,5,"Their Detroit-style square pizza is incredible - crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior, and those corner pieces are to die for! The pepperoni cup and char perfectly. Worth the 30-minute wait."
Righteous ranch drizzle,2024-07-05,5,Their house-made ranch drizzle takes their pizzas to another level. It's not your typical ranch - has hints of dill and garlic with a perfect consistency that adds creaminess without making things soggy.

Greasy and disappointing,2023-09-12,2,"I had high hopes based on the reviews, but my pizza was swimming in grease. The crust was undercooked in the center, and the promised 'fresh vegetables' looked and tasted canned. Such a letdown."
Underwhelming and basic,2024-06-23,3,"Nothing particularly wrong with it, but nothing memorable either. Standard crust, standard sauce, standard toppings. In a city with so many pizza options, this place doesn't give you any reason to return."
Rude staff ruined the meal,2024-04-15,2,"The pizza itself was decent, but the counter staff was incredibly rude - sighing when I asked questions about ingredients, rushing my order, and actually rolling their eyes when I requested extra napkins."
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2024-12-01,5,They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!

Perfect textural contrast,2024-03-05,5,"The contrast between the crisp bottom, the tender interior crumb, the gooey cheese, and the slight resistance of the toppings creates a textural symphony. Each bite is interesting and satisfying in a different way."
Sauce like ketchup,2025-04-12,2,"The sauce was suspiciously sweet and one-dimensional, reminiscent of ketchup rather than a proper pizza sauce. No evidence of herbs, garlic, or any complexity. Ruined what otherwise could have been a decent pizza."
Dirty restaurant,2023-04-18,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."
Cheese solidified too quickly,2025-06-28,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Perfect for large parties,2024-01-29,5,"Their party package is fantastic - multiple 18-inch pizzas with varied toppings, plenty of sides, and they were accommodating with our group of 20. Everything arrived hot and on time, and they included all the necessary paper goods."
Perfect balance of flavors,2023-06-24,5,"Their 'Mediterranean' pizza has the perfect balance of flavors - the briny olives, tangy feta, fresh tomatoes, and herb-infused olive oil all complement each other without any one element overwhelming the others."
Disappointed with service,2024-08-06,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."

Sloppy presentation,2025-01-27,3,"The pizza looked like it had been assembled in a hurry - toppings haphazardly thrown on, cheese unevenly distributed, and the cutting was so uneven that some slices were twice the size of others. Taste was okay, but appearance matters too."
Too much salt in the dough,2025-05-24,2,The crust was so salty it was almost inedible - overwhelmed all the other flavors and left me incredibly thirsty afterward. A heavy hand with salt ruined what could have been a good pizza.
Tasteless cheese substitute,2025-03-08,2,"Their vegan cheese option was terrible - had no meltability, a grainy texture, and tasted strongly of coconut which clashed with the tomato sauce. If you can't do vegan cheese well, better to offer cheese-free options that are properly balanced."
Tough leathery crust,2023-02-21,2,"The crust was so tough I almost couldn't bite through it - like trying to eat leather. The edges were particularly problematic, had to tear pieces off with significant effort. Completely lacks the pleasant chewiness good pizza should have."
Superior ingredients make the difference,2025-06-07,5,"They import their flour from Italy, use San Marzano tomatoes, and make their mozzarella in-house daily. The commitment to quality ingredients is evident in every bite - nothing is an afterthought."
Perfect for lunch specials,2025-04-29,4,"Their lunch deal is unbeatable - $10 for a 10-inch pizza and small salad. The pizza comes out quickly, is always fresh, and the perfect size for one person. Great place for a work lunch."
Perfect for watching sports,2025-04-13,4,"Great setup with TVs visible from every table, excellent pitcher specials during games, and their 'Game Day' pizza loaded with multiple meats and jalapeños is the perfect sports-watching food. Atmosphere gets lively but not obnoxious."
Disappointed with service,2023-01-28,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."
Weird aftertaste,2024-01-29,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."
Too thin to be satisfying,2024-01-05,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Excellent for takeout,2023-03-18,4,"Their pizza travels remarkably well. Even after a 20-minute drive home, the crust was still crispy and everything was at the perfect temperature. They have their packaging technique down to a science."
Perfect balance of flavors,2024-09-08,5,"Their 'Mediterranean' pizza has the perfect balance of flavors - the briny olives, tangy feta, fresh tomatoes, and herb-infused olive oil all complement each other without any one element overwhelming the others."
Way too much oregano,2025-01-27,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
Perfect for lunch specials,2024-03-08,4,"Their lunch deal is unbeatable - $10 for a 10-inch pizza and small salad. The pizza comes out quickly, is always fresh, and the perfect size for one person. Great place for a work lunch."
Best pizza in town,2024-05-21,5,"The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Their signature pepperoni pizza had the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, and the pepperoni curled up into little cups of deliciousness. Will definitely be back!"
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2023-08-17,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."
Burned mouth on first bite,2023-10-09,2,"They served the pizza dangerously hot - barely out of the oven with no time to cool. Severely burned the roof of my mouth on the first bite, which ruined the rest of the meal and my next few days."
Perfect crust-to-topping ratio,2024-05-31,5,"Some places overload toppings so the crust gets soggy, others are too sparse. This place gets it perfect - enough toppings to get some in every bite, but not so much that the structural integrity is compromised."
Too much cheese,2023-11-22,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Incredible vodka sauce base,2024-01-13,5,"Their vodka sauce pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil is something special. The creamy, slightly spicy sauce is a perfect alternative to traditional tomato sauce. Add prosciutto for an extra flavor dimension!"
Painfully obvious cheap ingredients,2025-01-27,2,"The pre-shredded cheese didn't melt properly, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the sausage had that distinctive processed flavor. At these prices, cutting corners on ingredients is inexcusable."
Crispy yet chewy perfection,2023-08-30,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."
Authentic coal-fired perfection,2023-01-27,5,Their coal-fired oven gives the pizza a distinctive char and smoky flavor that's impossible to replicate any other way. The slight bitterness of the charred spots perfectly balances the sweetness of the sauce.
Too expensive for pizza,2024-05-05,3,"The pizza is good, I'll give them that. But $30 for a basic large cheese pizza is highway robbery. Add toppings and you're looking at $40-50. The quality doesn't justify these premium prices."
Way too much crust,2024-03-15,2,The edge crust (cornicione) was comically large - almost half of each slice was just bread with no toppings. This ratio of crust to actual pizza was way off and made for a disappointing experience.
Lackluster veggie options,2023-03-19,3,"Their vegetable toppings lacked freshness and flavor - the mushrooms were clearly canned, the peppers were soft and faded, and the onions were sparse. Disappointing for a place that advertises farm-fresh ingredients."
Weird aftertaste,2024-03-24,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."
Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2023-10-04,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
Perfect for big groups,2023-03-09,5,"We had a party of 12 and they accommodated us perfectly. Their 20-inch shareable pizzas are great for groups, and they were happy to do half-and-half toppings to please everyone. Service was impressively coordinated."
Perfect for picky eaters,2024-05-18,4,Their 'build your own quarter' option is genius - a large pizza divided into quadrants with different toppings. Perfect for our family where everyone wants something different. No more ordering multiple pizzas!

Too greasy to enjoy,2024-08-09,2,"Had to literally blot my pizza with napkins, which came away completely saturated with grease. Whatever flavor might have been there was drowned in oil. Couldn't finish it as it was making me feel ill."
Excellent Chicago deep dish,2024-05-28,5,"Hard to find authentic Chicago-style pizza in this area, but they nail it. The buttery, flaky crust, the layering of cheese under the sauce, the chunky tomato topping - all perfect. Worth the 45-minute cook time."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2025-01-03,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Expert-level pizza folding,2024-09-15,5,Their thin-crust slices fold perfectly New York-style without cracking or losing toppings. The slight resistance before the fold is exactly what you want - showing the perfect balance of crisp and chew.
Brilliant seasonal rotation,2023-06-29,5,"Love that they have a rotating seasonal pizza that showcases what's fresh. The current spring offering with asparagus, green garlic, and fresh peas is bright and delicious - a perfect reflection of the season."
No-cheese option was all sauce,2024-04-07,2,"Ordered a cheese-free pizza for my dairy-allergic friend, but they made no adjustments - just removed the cheese and left a soggy sauce-covered bread. Good pizza without cheese requires rebalancing other elements."
Terrible delivery experience,2024-03-14,1,"Ordered for Valentine's Day and regretted it. Pizza took 2 hours to arrive, was cold, and had the wrong toppings. Called the restaurant and they seemed completely unconcerned. Never again."
Burnt crust ruins it,2024-06-25,2,"They claim 'char' is part of the Neapolitan experience, but there's a difference between char and burnt. The entire bottom of my pizza was black and bitter. Scraping it off meant losing half the crust."
False advertising on size,2023-07-07,2,"Their menu clearly states that a large pizza is 16 inches, but what we received couldn't have been more than 14 inches. When questioned, they claimed their menu was outdated but refused any adjustment."
Late night savior,2024-10-22,4,"Open until 2am on weekends, this place has saved me many times after a night out. Their slices are huge, reheated perfectly crisp, and they have creative toppings that hit the spot when you're hungry late at night."
Excessive grease pooling,2023-10-31,2,"Had to continuously blot the pizza with napkins as pools of orange grease formed on top of the cheese with every passing minute. By the end, the napkins were completely saturated and transparent. Felt unhealthy even by pizza standards."
Way too much oregano,2024-05-25,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
Too thin to be satisfying,2023-01-04,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Masterful use of olive oil,2023-12-17,5,"The drizzle of high-quality olive oil they add just before serving makes all the difference - adds richness, enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, and adds a wonderful aromatic element. Simple but transformative."
Excellent customer service,2023-12-31,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
Not worth the wait,2024-09-24,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."
Disappointed with service,2024-01-06,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."
Incredible vodka sauce base,2024-09-29,5,"Their vodka sauce pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil is something special. The creamy, slightly spicy sauce is a perfect alternative to traditional tomato sauce. Add prosciutto for an extra flavor dimension!"
Perfect for late-night cravings,2025-02-18,5,"Open until 3am on weekends, this place has saved many late nights. The slices are huge, they reheat them perfectly so they're crispy, and their special late-night menu items are creative and delicious."
Perfect for big groups,2024-06-08,5,"We had a party of 12 and they accommodated us perfectly. Their 20-inch shareable pizzas are great for groups, and they were happy to do half-and-half toppings to please everyone. Service was impressively coordinated."
Late night savior,2024-06-12,4,"Open until 2am on weekends, this place has saved me many times after a night out. Their slices are huge, reheated perfectly crisp, and they have creative toppings that hit the spot when you're hungry late at night."
Perfect for dietary restrictions,2024-10-28,5,"As someone with multiple food allergies, I appreciate that they take dietary concerns seriously. Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"
Crust like cardboard,2024-03-11,2,"The crust had all the flavor and texture of packing material - dry, tough, and completely devoid of character. Even the decent toppings couldn't save it. The foundation of good pizza is good dough, and this wasn't it."
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2023-10-31,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
Excellence in simplicity,2024-11-26,5,"Their classic Margherita showcases their commitment to quality - the balance of sweet-acidic tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella, fragrant basil, and that perfectly chewy-crisp crust. Proof that simple can be sublime."
Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2023-08-28,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies. The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."
Superior ingredients make the difference,2023-07-13,5,"They import their flour from Italy, use San Marzano tomatoes, and make their mozzarella in-house daily. The commitment to quality ingredients is evident in every bite - nothing is an afterthought."
Magnificent flavor layering,2024-09-20,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Too much cheese,2024-04-02,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Excellent for takeout,2025-05-20,4,"Their pizza travels remarkably well. Even after a 20-minute drive home, the crust was still crispy and everything was at the perfect temperature. They have their packaging technique down to a science."
Incredible vodka sauce base,2023-02-27,5,"Their vodka sauce pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil is something special. The creamy, slightly spicy sauce is a perfect alternative to traditional tomato sauce. Add prosciutto for an extra flavor dimension!"
Excellent wine pairings,2024-01-14,5,"Their curated wine list is designed specifically to pair with their pizzas, and the staff is knowledgeable about suggesting the perfect match. The house red with their sausage pizza is a transcendent combination."
Authentic Italian experience,2024-07-16,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
Masterful use of olive oil,2024-10-31,5,"The drizzle of high-quality olive oil they add just before serving makes all the difference - adds richness, enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, and adds a wonderful aromatic element. Simple but transformative."
Perfect thin crust,2025-05-15,5,"If you're a thin crust fan, this is your place. Cracker-thin, crispy all the way through, yet somehow still has a nice chew. Their simple cheese pizza showcases their excellent sauce - slightly sweet with a nice herb blend."
Tough leathery crust,2025-05-20,2,"The crust was so tough I almost couldn't bite through it - like trying to eat leather. The edges were particularly problematic, had to tear pieces off with significant effort. Completely lacks the pleasant chewiness good pizza should have."
Undercooked in the middle,2023-07-14,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."
Too salty,2025-05-22,2,"Everything I tried was oversalted - the crust, the sauce, and especially the cheese. It was like they were trying to ensure you'd order more drinks. Couldn't finish my pizza and was thirsty all night."
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2024-06-05,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
Too much garlic,2023-03-05,3,"I love garlic but this was excessive - felt like they mistook cloves for teaspoons in the recipe. My breath was lethal afterward, and the powerful flavor overwhelmed the other ingredients."
Outstanding breakfast pizza,2023-10-01,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
Innovative flavor combinations,2023-02-18,5,"Their 'Avant Garde' menu section features combinations I would never have thought of but somehow work perfectly. The pear, gorgonzola, walnut, and honey pizza was a revelation of sweet, salty, and savory harmony."
Sloppy presentation,2024-04-10,3,"The pizza looked like it had been assembled in a hurry - toppings haphazardly thrown on, cheese unevenly distributed, and the cutting was so uneven that some slices were twice the size of others. Taste was okay, but appearance matters too."
Pizza arrived upside-down,2025-04-14,1,Delivery driver must have taken a sharp turn because our pizza arrived completely flipped over in the box - all toppings stuck to the lid. Restaurant offered no solution other than suggesting we 'scrape it off and reassemble it.'
Superior ingredients make the difference,2025-02-17,5,"They import their flour from Italy, use San Marzano tomatoes, and make their mozzarella in-house daily. The commitment to quality ingredients is evident in every bite - nothing is an afterthought."
Terrible delivery experience,2023-09-01,1,"Ordered for Valentine's Day and regretted it. Pizza took 2 hours to arrive, was cold, and had the wrong toppings. Called the restaurant and they seemed completely unconcerned. Never again."
Rude staff ruined the meal,2025-06-03,2,"The pizza itself was decent, but the counter staff was incredibly rude - sighing when I asked questions about ingredients, rushing my order, and actually rolling their eyes when I requested extra napkins."
Perfect for late-night cravings,2023-12-23,5,"Open until 3am on weekends, this place has saved many late nights. The slices are huge, they reheat them perfectly so they're crispy, and their special late-night menu items are creative and delicious."
Refrigerated dough taste,2025-03-18,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."
Perfect buffalo mozzarella application,2024-12-27,5,They understand that buffalo mozzarella shouldn't be cooked too long or it loses its distinctive texture and flavor. Applied in dollops after the pizza is mostly baked so it just barely melts while maintaining its creamy integrity. Technical perfection!
Best pizza in town,2023-01-03,5,"The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Their signature pepperoni pizza had the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, and the pepperoni curled up into little cups of deliciousness. Will definitely be back!"
Bland sauce needs work,2025-06-07,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2024-01-24,2,The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing.
Late night savior,2024-06-20,4,"Open until 2am on weekends, this place has saved me many times after a night out. Their slices are huge, reheated perfectly crisp, and they have creative toppings that hit the spot when you're hungry late at night."
Not enough cheese,2024-05-19,3,"The sauce and crust were good, but they're stingy with cheese. You could see the sauce through the sparse cheese layer, and what was there didn't have that stretchy pull you want from a good pizza."
Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2025-04-19,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies. The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."
Excellent attention to cooking time,2025-04-05,5,They nail the cooking time perfectly - pulling the pizza from the oven at exactly the right moment when the cheese is fully melted and bubbling but not yet browned. Shows expertise and attention to detail.
Perfect for kids' parties,2023-04-12,5,"Hosted my son's birthday here and it was fantastic. They did a dough-tossing demonstration for the kids, let them make their own mini pizzas, and the staff was incredibly patient and kind."
Authentic Italian experience,2024-12-03,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
Spicy special was too much,2024-12-21,2,Their 'Firebreather' pizza should come with a warning label. It wasn't enjoyably spicy - it was painfully hot to the point where I couldn't taste anything else. Had to throw most of it away.
Disappointed with service,2025-03-05,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."
Tasteless cheese substitute,2024-07-15,2,"Their vegan cheese option was terrible - had no meltability, a grainy texture, and tasted strongly of coconut which clashed with the tomato sauce. If you can't do vegan cheese well, better to offer cheese-free options that are properly balanced."
Perfect for watching sports,2023-02-20,4,"Great setup with TVs visible from every table, excellent pitcher specials during games, and their 'Game Day' pizza loaded with multiple meats and jalapeños is the perfect sports-watching food. Atmosphere gets lively but not obnoxious."
Crust like cardboard,2024-04-11,2,"The crust had all the flavor and texture of packing material - dry, tough, and completely devoid of character. Even the decent toppings couldn't save it. The foundation of good pizza is good dough, and this wasn't it."
Sloppy presentation,2024-07-02,3,"The pizza looked like it had been assembled in a hurry - toppings haphazardly thrown on, cheese unevenly distributed, and the cutting was so uneven that some slices were twice the size of others. Taste was okay, but appearance matters too."
Stale-tasting crust,2024-07-10,2,"The crust had a stale, almost cardboard-like quality that suggests either old dough or old flour. Fresh ingredients on top couldn't compensate for the foundation being off."
Spicy special was too much,2024-04-07,2,Their 'Firebreather' pizza should come with a warning label. It wasn't enjoyably spicy - it was painfully hot to the point where I couldn't taste anything else. Had to throw most of it away.
Tiny portion sizes,2024-04-17,2,"Their 'personal' pizza is the size of a CD. For $15, I expected something that would actually satisfy my hunger. Had to order a second one, turning a quick lunch into an expensive disappointment."
Supreme quality control,2023-10-02,5,"Visited multiple times and the consistency is impressive - every pizza comes out identical to the last one, with the same excellent quality. Shows serious commitment to training and standards that's rare in casual dining."
Perfect crunch factor,2023-06-26,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."
Crust like cardboard,2024-12-11,2,"The crust had all the flavor and texture of packing material - dry, tough, and completely devoid of character. Even the decent toppings couldn't save it. The foundation of good pizza is good dough, and this wasn't it."

Masterful use of olive oil,2024-06-22,5,"The drizzle of high-quality olive oil they add just before serving makes all the difference - adds richness, enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, and adds a wonderful aromatic element. Simple but transformative."
Perfect crust-to-topping ratio,2023-09-07,5,"Some places overload toppings so the crust gets soggy, others are too sparse. This place gets it perfect - enough toppings to get some in every bite, but not so much that the structural integrity is compromised."
Best white pizza ever,2023-04-17,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"
Tomato sauce tasted rancid,2023-08-19,1,"The sauce had a distinctly off flavor that suggested the tomatoes had gone bad before processing. After two bites, couldn't continue eating as the rancid notes became more pronounced. Basic food safety seems questionable."
Not worth the wait,2024-08-13,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."
Outstanding variety of options,2023-03-25,5,"Their menu has something for everyone - traditional options done well, creative specialties, and customizable choices. Even have dessert pizzas that are surprisingly good (try the Nutella and banana!)."
Overpriced for what you get,2024-12-11,3,"$24 for a medium pizza with just two toppings seems excessive. The ingredients were fresh and the crust was good, but nothing justified the premium price. There are better values elsewhere in town."
Refrigerated dough taste,2025-03-05,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."
Exceptional spinach ricotta pie,2023-05-15,5,Their white pizza with spinach and ricotta is exceptional - the creamy richness of the cheese balanced by the slight bitterness of the greens. The garlic-infused olive oil base ties everything together perfectly.
Perfect NY-style slices,2024-09-23,5,"As a transplant from NYC, I've been searching for authentic NY-style pizza. This place nails it - thin, foldable slices with the right amount of chew and grease. Their plain cheese slice is perfection."
Too expensive for pizza,2023-12-19,3,"The pizza is good, I'll give them that. But $30 for a basic large cheese pizza is highway robbery. Add toppings and you're looking at $40-50. The quality doesn't justify these premium prices."
No-cheese option was all sauce,2023-05-23,2,"Ordered a cheese-free pizza for my dairy-allergic friend, but they made no adjustments - just removed the cheese and left a soggy sauce-covered bread. Good pizza without cheese requires rebalancing other elements."
Not worth the wait,2025-02-09,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."

Terrible delivery experience,2023-03-20,1,"Ordered for Valentine's Day and regretted it. Pizza took 2 hours to arrive, was cold, and had the wrong toppings. Called the restaurant and they seemed completely unconcerned. Never again."
Magnificent flavor layering,2024-10-10,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Toppings slide right off,2024-12-24,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Perfect crunch factor,2025-01-15,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."
Stale-tasting crust,2024-04-09,2,"The crust had a stale, almost cardboard-like quality that suggests either old dough or old flour. Fresh ingredients on top couldn't compensate for the foundation being off."
Toppings slide right off,2023-06-02,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Excessive grease pooling,2025-02-13,2,"Had to continuously blot the pizza with napkins as pools of orange grease formed on top of the cheese with every passing minute. By the end, the napkins were completely saturated and transparent. Felt unhealthy even by pizza standards."
Perfect for dietary restrictions,2023-10-26,5,"As someone with multiple food allergies, I appreciate that they take dietary concerns seriously. Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"
Tiny portion sizes,2024-10-08,2,"Their 'personal' pizza is the size of a CD. For $15, I expected something that would actually satisfy my hunger. Had to order a second one, turning a quick lunch into an expensive disappointment."
Authentic coal-fired perfection,2023-04-10,5,Their coal-fired oven gives the pizza a distinctive char and smoky flavor that's impossible to replicate any other way. The slight bitterness of the charred spots perfectly balances the sweetness of the sauce.
Too greasy to enjoy,2023-03-17,2,"Had to literally blot my pizza with napkins, which came away completely saturated with grease. Whatever flavor might have been there was drowned in oil. Couldn't finish it as it was making me feel ill."
Best white pizza ever,2023-08-01,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"
Righteous ranch drizzle,2024-09-24,5,Their house-made ranch drizzle takes their pizzas to another level. It's not your typical ranch - has hints of dill and garlic with a perfect consistency that adds creaminess without making things soggy.
Perfect NY-style slices,2023-03-29,5,"As a transplant from NYC, I've been searching for authentic NY-style pizza. This place nails it - thin, foldable slices with the right amount of chew and grease. Their plain cheese slice is perfection."
Burned mouth on first bite,2023-02-11,2,"They served the pizza dangerously hot - barely out of the oven with no time to cool. Severely burned the roof of my mouth on the first bite, which ruined the rest of the meal and my next few days."
Way too much crust,2023-11-27,2,The edge crust (cornicione) was comically large - almost half of each slice was just bread with no toppings. This ratio of crust to actual pizza was way off and made for a disappointing experience.
Innovative flavor combinations,2024-06-02,5,"Their 'Avant Garde' menu section features combinations I would never have thought of but somehow work perfectly. The pear, gorgonzola, walnut, and honey pizza was a revelation of sweet, salty, and savory harmony."
Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2024-02-11,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
Bland sauce needs work,2023-02-27,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
Masterful use of olive oil,2025-01-29,5,"The drizzle of high-quality olive oil they add just before serving makes all the difference - adds richness, enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, and adds a wonderful aromatic element. Simple but transformative."
Skimpy on toppings,2024-03-28,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."
Rude staff ruined the meal,2023-07-15,2,"The pizza itself was decent, but the counter staff was incredibly rude - sighing when I asked questions about ingredients, rushing my order, and actually rolling their eyes when I requested extra napkins."
Expert-level pizza folding,2023-09-29,5,Their thin-crust slices fold perfectly New York-style without cracking or losing toppings. The slight resistance before the fold is exactly what you want - showing the perfect balance of crisp and chew.
Excellence in simplicity,2023-11-15,5,"Their classic Margherita showcases their commitment to quality - the balance of sweet-acidic tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella, fragrant basil, and that perfectly chewy-crisp crust. Proof that simple can be sublime."
No flavor distinction,2024-03-31,3,Ordered two completely different specialty pizzas but they somehow tasted nearly identical. It's like they use the same base for everything and the toppings don't impart enough distinctive character.
Hidden gem for vegans,2025-01-11,5,"I can't believe how good their vegan pizza is! They make their own cashew cheese that actually melts properly, and their vegetable toppings are always fresh and seasonal. Even my non-vegan friends love it."
Excellence in simplicity,2023-01-16,5,"Their classic Margherita showcases their commitment to quality - the balance of sweet-acidic tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella, fragrant basil, and that perfectly chewy-crisp crust. Proof that simple can be sublime."
Great gluten-free option,2024-09-13,4,"As someone with celiac disease, finding good gluten-free pizza is a challenge. Their cauliflower crust was one of the best I've had - doesn't fall apart and has a nice flavor. Toppings were generous too."
Perfect temperature every time,2025-06-15,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
Bland sauce needs work,2023-05-01,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
Terrible delivery experience,2024-05-05,1,"Ordered for Valentine's Day and regretted it. Pizza took 2 hours to arrive, was cold, and had the wrong toppings. Called the restaurant and they seemed completely unconcerned. Never again."
Crispy yet chewy perfection,2024-05-18,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."
Masterful use of olive oil,2023-04-19,5,"The drizzle of high-quality olive oil they add just before serving makes all the difference - adds richness, enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, and adds a wonderful aromatic element. Simple but transformative."
Epic meat lovers option,2024-06-09,4,"If you're a carnivore, their 'Butcher's Block' pizza is incredible. Five different meats, all high quality - the soppressata and house-made sausage are standouts. Just be ready for a food coma afterward!"
Too expensive for pizza,2024-06-05,3,"The pizza is good, I'll give them that. But $30 for a basic large cheese pizza is highway robbery. Add toppings and you're looking at $40-50. The quality doesn't justify these premium prices."
Perfect temperature every time,2025-05-02,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
Perfectly crispy crust,2023-06-26,5,"However they achieve it, their crust has the perfect crispness all the way through - no soggy middle! Even the slices with lots of toppings maintain their structural integrity. Engineering marvel of pizza."
Too salty,2023-11-07,2,"Everything I tried was oversalted - the crust, the sauce, and especially the cheese. It was like they were trying to ensure you'd order more drinks. Couldn't finish my pizza and was thirsty all night."
Perfect balance of flavors,2024-06-14,5,"Their 'Mediterranean' pizza has the perfect balance of flavors - the briny olives, tangy feta, fresh tomatoes, and herb-infused olive oil all complement each other without any one element overwhelming the others."
Phenomenal crust,2024-12-16,5,"Whatever they do to their dough is magical - it's got that perfect combination of crispy and chewy with a slight sourdough tang. I could eat their plain crust by itself, it's that good."
Too greasy to enjoy,2023-07-23,2,"Had to literally blot my pizza with napkins, which came away completely saturated with grease. Whatever flavor might have been there was drowned in oil. Couldn't finish it as it was making me feel ill."
Too thin to be satisfying,2024-10-18,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Creative seasonal specials,2024-02-13,5,"Just had their spring special with asparagus, lemon ricotta, and prosciutto. The combination was bright, fresh, and perfect for the season. Love that they use local, seasonal ingredients."
Masterclass in proper baking,2025-05-15,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
Tasteless cheese substitute,2024-08-24,2,"Their vegan cheese option was terrible - had no meltability, a grainy texture, and tasted strongly of coconut which clashed with the tomato sauce. If you can't do vegan cheese well, better to offer cheese-free options that are properly balanced."
Skimpy on toppings,2024-06-09,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."
Cheese solidified too quickly,2024-03-23,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
No flavor distinction,2025-02-21,3,Ordered two completely different specialty pizzas but they somehow tasted nearly identical. It's like they use the same base for everything and the toppings don't impart enough distinctive character.
Burnt crust ruins it,2023-11-26,2,"They claim 'char' is part of the Neapolitan experience, but there's a difference between char and burnt. The entire bottom of my pizza was black and bitter. Scraping it off meant losing half the crust."
Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2023-09-10,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
Too much garlic,2025-02-27,3,"I love garlic but this was excessive - felt like they mistook cloves for teaspoons in the recipe. My breath was lethal afterward, and the powerful flavor overwhelmed the other ingredients."
Tasteless cheese substitute,2023-03-21,2,"Their vegan cheese option was terrible - had no meltability, a grainy texture, and tasted strongly of coconut which clashed with the tomato sauce. If you can't do vegan cheese well, better to offer cheese-free options that are properly balanced."
Too much sauce,2025-05-16,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Excellent Chicago deep dish,2023-02-11,5,"Hard to find authentic Chicago-style pizza in this area, but they nail it. The buttery, flaky crust, the layering of cheese under the sauce, the chunky tomato topping - all perfect. Worth the 45-minute cook time."
Painfully obvious cheap ingredients,2023-01-14,2,"The pre-shredded cheese didn't melt properly, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the sausage had that distinctive processed flavor. At these prices, cutting corners on ingredients is inexcusable."
Burnt crust ruins it,2023-07-21,2,"They claim 'char' is part of the Neapolitan experience, but there's a difference between char and burnt. The entire bottom of my pizza was black and bitter. Scraping it off meant losing half the crust."
Toppings slide right off,2024-08-02,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Unmelted cheese in the center,2024-04-18,2,"The edges were fine but the center had cold, unmelted cheese - a sign the oven wasn't hot enough or the pizza wasn't cooked long enough. Basic pizza fundamentals seem to be lacking."
Late night savior,2023-12-26,4,"Open until 2am on weekends, this place has saved me many times after a night out. Their slices are huge, reheated perfectly crisp, and they have creative toppings that hit the spot when you're hungry late at night."
Excessive grease pooling,2025-04-06,2,"Had to continuously blot the pizza with napkins as pools of orange grease formed on top of the cheese with every passing minute. By the end, the napkins were completely saturated and transparent. Felt unhealthy even by pizza standards."
Perfect crust-to-topping ratio,2024-09-07,5,"Some places overload toppings so the crust gets soggy, others are too sparse. This place gets it perfect - enough toppings to get some in every bite, but not so much that the structural integrity is compromised."
Excellent Chicago deep dish,2025-03-21,5,"Hard to find authentic Chicago-style pizza in this area, but they nail it. The buttery, flaky crust, the layering of cheese under the sauce, the chunky tomato topping - all perfect. Worth the 45-minute cook time."
Brilliant use of fermented dough,2023-06-30,5,Their 72-hour fermented dough has incredible depth of flavor with subtle sourdough notes. The extended fermentation creates a complex web of flavors and perfect texture that you simply can't achieve with quick-rise methods.
Incredible vodka sauce base,2023-05-07,5,"Their vodka sauce pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil is something special. The creamy, slightly spicy sauce is a perfect alternative to traditional tomato sauce. Add prosciutto for an extra flavor dimension!"
Perfect crunch factor,2024-06-23,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."
Innovative toppings,2023-08-12,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."
Excellent Chicago deep dish,2023-04-11,5,"Hard to find authentic Chicago-style pizza in this area, but they nail it. The buttery, flaky crust, the layering of cheese under the sauce, the chunky tomato topping - all perfect. Worth the 45-minute cook time."
Disappointed with service,2023-01-01,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."
Excessive grease pooling,2024-05-23,2,"Had to continuously blot the pizza with napkins as pools of orange grease formed on top of the cheese with every passing minute. By the end, the napkins were completely saturated and transparent. Felt unhealthy even by pizza standards."
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2023-02-21,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."
Perfect temperature every time,2024-02-11,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
Too salty,2024-09-23,2,"Everything I tried was oversalted - the crust, the sauce, and especially the cheese. It was like they were trying to ensure you'd order more drinks. Couldn't finish my pizza and was thirsty all night."
Perfect for large parties,2025-06-16,5,"Their party package is fantastic - multiple 18-inch pizzas with varied toppings, plenty of sides, and they were accommodating with our group of 20. Everything arrived hot and on time, and they included all the necessary paper goods."
Supreme quality control,2024-05-15,5,"Visited multiple times and the consistency is impressive - every pizza comes out identical to the last one, with the same excellent quality. Shows serious commitment to training and standards that's rare in casual dining."
Best Hawaiian in the city,2024-05-18,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."
Rude staff ruined the meal,2024-11-05,2,"The pizza itself was decent, but the counter staff was incredibly rude - sighing when I asked questions about ingredients, rushing my order, and actually rolling their eyes when I requested extra napkins."
Excellent Chicago deep dish,2023-09-15,5,"Hard to find authentic Chicago-style pizza in this area, but they nail it. The buttery, flaky crust, the layering of cheese under the sauce, the chunky tomato topping - all perfect. Worth the 45-minute cook time."
Brilliant seasonal rotation,2023-02-27,5,"Love that they have a rotating seasonal pizza that showcases what's fresh. The current spring offering with asparagus, green garlic, and fresh peas is bright and delicious - a perfect reflection of the season."
Crispy yet chewy perfection,2024-06-24,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."
Perfect for dietary restrictions,2024-03-10,5,"As someone with multiple food allergies, I appreciate that they take dietary concerns seriously. Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"
Perfect pepperoni placement,2024-01-28,5,"As a pepperoni perfectionist, I appreciate that they space the pepperoni so every bite gets one full piece. No bare spots or clumped areas. Shows attention to detail that elevates the whole experience."
Inconsistent quality,2023-04-26,3,I've been here three times. First visit: amazing. Second: terrible. Third: just okay. Seems like it really depends on who's working that day. Wish they could maintain better quality control.
Perfect for kids' parties,2023-07-21,5,"Hosted my son's birthday here and it was fantastic. They did a dough-tossing demonstration for the kids, let them make their own mini pizzas, and the staff was incredibly patient and kind."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2023-09-25,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Best Hawaiian in the city,2025-02-04,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."

Authentic coal-fired perfection,2024-10-22,5,Their coal-fired oven gives the pizza a distinctive char and smoky flavor that's impossible to replicate any other way. The slight bitterness of the charred spots perfectly balances the sweetness of the sauce.
Not worth the wait,2024-03-28,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."
Stale-tasting crust,2023-03-03,2,"The crust had a stale, almost cardboard-like quality that suggests either old dough or old flour. Fresh ingredients on top couldn't compensate for the foundation being off."
Too much emphasis on appearance,2023-10-22,3,"The pizza was clearly designed to look good in photos - perfect symmetry, vibrant colors, photogenic cheese pull - but the flavor was underwhelming. Style over substance for the Instagram crowd."
Perfectly crispy crust,2025-02-23,5,"However they achieve it, their crust has the perfect crispness all the way through - no soggy middle! Even the slices with lots of toppings maintain their structural integrity. Engineering marvel of pizza."
False advertising on ingredients,2023-10-10,1,"Menu promised 'house-made Italian sausage' but what came on my pizza was clearly pre-formed, uniform pellets of commercial sausage. When questioned, staff admitted they don't make any ingredients in-house despite menu claims."
Absurdly small slices,2024-11-10,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."
Too expensive for pizza,2023-10-29,3,"The pizza is good, I'll give them that. But $30 for a basic large cheese pizza is highway robbery. Add toppings and you're looking at $40-50. The quality doesn't justify these premium prices."
Rude staff ruined the meal,2024-06-08,2,"The pizza itself was decent, but the counter staff was incredibly rude - sighing when I asked questions about ingredients, rushing my order, and actually rolling their eyes when I requested extra napkins."
Perfect ingredient distribution,2024-07-20,5,"Every bite had the perfect combination of ingredients - no barren spots, no overwhelming clumps. The toppings were distributed with such precision it almost seemed measured. The mark of true professionals!"
Crispy yet chewy perfection,2025-06-14,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."
Tiny portion sizes,2023-04-24,2,"Their 'personal' pizza is the size of a CD. For $15, I expected something that would actually satisfy my hunger. Had to order a second one, turning a quick lunch into an expensive disappointment."
Toppings slide right off,2023-09-09,2,The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate.
Doughy and undercooked,2023-05-12,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Great gluten-free option,2024-05-16,4,"As someone with celiac disease, finding good gluten-free pizza is a challenge. Their cauliflower crust was one of the best I've had - doesn't fall apart and has a nice flavor. Toppings were generous too."
Way too much oregano,2023-03-14,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
Perfect crunch factor,2024-10-25,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."

Too noisy for conversation,2025-05-29,3,The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option.
Terrible delivery experience,2023-09-16,1,"Ordered for Valentine's Day and regretted it. Pizza took 2 hours to arrive, was cold, and had the wrong toppings. Called the restaurant and they seemed completely unconcerned. Never again."
Too expensive for pizza,2024-11-02,3,"The pizza is good, I'll give them that. But $30 for a basic large cheese pizza is highway robbery. Add toppings and you're looking at $40-50. The quality doesn't justify these premium prices."
Undercooked in the middle,2024-10-04,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."
Sloppy presentation,2023-11-19,3,"The pizza looked like it had been assembled in a hurry - toppings haphazardly thrown on, cheese unevenly distributed, and the cutting was so uneven that some slices were twice the size of others. Taste was okay, but appearance matters too."
Perfect ingredient distribution,2024-12-15,5,"Every bite had the perfect combination of ingredients - no barren spots, no overwhelming clumps. The toppings were distributed with such precision it almost seemed measured. The mark of true professionals!"

Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2023-01-23,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies. The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."

Outstanding wood-fired perfection,2025-02-12,5,The wood-fired oven gives their pizza a distinctive smoky complexity you can't get any other way. The slight char adds bitterness that balances the sweetness of the sauce perfectly. Worth seeking out for this unique flavor profile.
Cheese solidified too quickly,2024-02-17,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Painfully obvious cheap ingredients,2025-03-07,2,"The pre-shredded cheese didn't melt properly, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the sausage had that distinctive processed flavor. At these prices, cutting corners on ingredients is inexcusable."

Exceptional spinach ricotta pie,2025-03-06,5,Their white pizza with spinach and ricotta is exceptional - the creamy richness of the cheese balanced by the slight bitterness of the greens. The garlic-infused olive oil base ties everything together perfectly.
Excellent wine pairings,2024-11-15,5,"Their curated wine list is designed specifically to pair with their pizzas, and the staff is knowledgeable about suggesting the perfect match. The house red with their sausage pizza is a transcendent combination."
Magnificent flavor layering,2024-11-21,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Best white pizza ever,2023-07-16,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"
Too much garlic,2023-12-19,3,"I love garlic but this was excessive - felt like they mistook cloves for teaspoons in the recipe. My breath was lethal afterward, and the powerful flavor overwhelmed the other ingredients."
Too much salt in the dough,2023-07-19,2,The crust was so salty it was almost inedible - overwhelmed all the other flavors and left me incredibly thirsty afterward. A heavy hand with salt ruined what could have been a good pizza.
Skimpy on toppings,2023-07-21,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2025-04-23,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Masterclass in proper baking,2024-03-08,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."

No-cheese option was all sauce,2024-12-17,2,"Ordered a cheese-free pizza for my dairy-allergic friend, but they made no adjustments - just removed the cheese and left a soggy sauce-covered bread. Good pizza without cheese requires rebalancing other elements."
Exceptional sauce-making technique,2024-03-25,5,"You can tell their sauce is made with properly hand-crushed tomatoes - it has that perfect texture with small chunks rather than being completely smooth. The bright flavor suggests minimal cooking, allowing the tomato quality to shine."
Too salty,2023-06-22,2,"Everything I tried was oversalted - the crust, the sauce, and especially the cheese. It was like they were trying to ensure you'd order more drinks. Couldn't finish my pizza and was thirsty all night."

Cold center burnt edges,2024-08-02,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Not worth the wait,2024-10-17,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."
New owners ruined it,2025-03-11,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."
Too greasy to enjoy,2025-06-13,2,"Had to literally blot my pizza with napkins, which came away completely saturated with grease. Whatever flavor might have been there was drowned in oil. Couldn't finish it as it was making me feel ill."
Outstanding breakfast pizza,2023-12-04,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
Greasy and disappointing,2023-12-29,2,"I had high hopes based on the reviews, but my pizza was swimming in grease. The crust was undercooked in the center, and the promised 'fresh vegetables' looked and tasted canned. Such a letdown."

Phenomenal crust,2024-09-21,5,"Whatever they do to their dough is magical - it's got that perfect combination of crispy and chewy with a slight sourdough tang. I could eat their plain crust by itself, it's that good."
Innovative toppings,2023-03-17,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2023-05-01,5,They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!

Dirty restaurant,2024-03-09,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."
Perfect temperature every time,2023-06-11,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
Skimpy on toppings,2024-12-31,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."

Excessive grease pooling,2025-02-11,2,"Had to continuously blot the pizza with napkins as pools of orange grease formed on top of the cheese with every passing minute. By the end, the napkins were completely saturated and transparent. Felt unhealthy even by pizza standards."
Excellent for takeout,2024-01-17,4,"Their pizza travels remarkably well. Even after a 20-minute drive home, the crust was still crispy and everything was at the perfect temperature. They have their packaging technique down to a science."

Crust like cardboard,2024-02-03,2,"The crust had all the flavor and texture of packing material - dry, tough, and completely devoid of character. Even the decent toppings couldn't save it. The foundation of good pizza is good dough, and this wasn't it."

Exceptional spinach ricotta pie,2024-03-18,5,Their white pizza with spinach and ricotta is exceptional - the creamy richness of the cheese balanced by the slight bitterness of the greens. The garlic-infused olive oil base ties everything together perfectly.
Expert-level pizza folding,2024-05-11,5,Their thin-crust slices fold perfectly New York-style without cracking or losing toppings. The slight resistance before the fold is exactly what you want - showing the perfect balance of crisp and chew.
New owners ruined it,2024-04-15,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."
Perfect buffalo mozzarella application,2023-09-18,5,They understand that buffalo mozzarella shouldn't be cooked too long or it loses its distinctive texture and flavor. Applied in dollops after the pizza is mostly baked so it just barely melts while maintaining its creamy integrity. Technical perfection!
Supreme quality control,2023-09-07,5,"Visited multiple times and the consistency is impressive - every pizza comes out identical to the last one, with the same excellent quality. Shows serious commitment to training and standards that's rare in casual dining."
Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2025-04-09,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies. The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."
Painfully obvious cheap ingredients,2024-02-16,2,"The pre-shredded cheese didn't melt properly, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the sausage had that distinctive processed flavor. At these prices, cutting corners on ingredients is inexcusable."
Excellence in simplicity,2024-10-23,5,"Their classic Margherita showcases their commitment to quality - the balance of sweet-acidic tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella, fragrant basil, and that perfectly chewy-crisp crust. Proof that simple can be sublime."
Too much garlic,2023-09-25,3,"I love garlic but this was excessive - felt like they mistook cloves for teaspoons in the recipe. My breath was lethal afterward, and the powerful flavor overwhelmed the other ingredients."
No-cheese option was all sauce,2024-03-12,2,"Ordered a cheese-free pizza for my dairy-allergic friend, but they made no adjustments - just removed the cheese and left a soggy sauce-covered bread. Good pizza without cheese requires rebalancing other elements."

Superior ingredients make the difference,2023-12-16,5,"They import their flour from Italy, use San Marzano tomatoes, and make their mozzarella in-house daily. The commitment to quality ingredients is evident in every bite - nothing is an afterthought."
Burnt crust ruins it,2025-06-08,2,"They claim 'char' is part of the Neapolitan experience, but there's a difference between char and burnt. The entire bottom of my pizza was black and bitter. Scraping it off meant losing half the crust."
Mediocre at best,2024-12-12,3,"Nothing terrible but nothing special either. The crust was okay, toppings were standard, and service was fine. It's the kind of place you go when you're in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip for."
Tiny portion sizes,2023-06-12,2,"Their 'personal' pizza is the size of a CD. For $15, I expected something that would actually satisfy my hunger. Had to order a second one, turning a quick lunch into an expensive disappointment."

The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."
Way too much crust,2024-09-05,2,The edge crust (cornicione) was comically large - almost half of each slice was just bread with no toppings. This ratio of crust to actual pizza was way off and made for a disappointing experience.
Innovative flavor combinations,2023-04-16,5,"Their 'Avant Garde' menu section features combinations I would never have thought of but somehow work perfectly. The pear, gorgonzola, walnut, and honey pizza was a revelation of sweet, salty, and savory harmony."
Best white pizza ever,2023-06-25,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"
Dirty restaurant,2025-05-16,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."
Burnt crust ruins it,2025-01-08,2,"They claim 'char' is part of the Neapolitan experience, but there's a difference between char and burnt. The entire bottom of my pizza was black and bitter. Scraping it off meant losing half the crust."
Brilliant use of fermented dough,2023-04-23,5,Their 72-hour fermented dough has incredible depth of flavor with subtle sourdough notes. The extended fermentation creates a complex web of flavors and perfect texture that you simply can't achieve with quick-rise methods.
No flavor distinction,2024-03-13,3,Ordered two completely different specialty pizzas but they somehow tasted nearly identical. It's like they use the same base for everything and the toppings don't impart enough distinctive character.
Undercooked in the middle,2025-04-27,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."

Too much cheese,2024-05-07,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Excellent attention to cooking time,2025-05-24,5,They nail the cooking time perfectly - pulling the pizza from the oven at exactly the right moment when the cheese is fully melted and bubbling but not yet browned. Shows expertise and attention to detail.
Burned bottom raw top,2024-11-25,1,The bottom of the crust was completely black while the cheese on top wasn't fully melted. This temperature imbalance suggests serious issues with their oven management and pizza-making technique.
Outstanding breakfast pizza,2024-04-09,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
Perfect temperature every time,2024-03-31,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
Spicy special was too much,2023-06-27,2,Their 'Firebreather' pizza should come with a warning label. It wasn't enjoyably spicy - it was painfully hot to the point where I couldn't taste anything else. Had to throw most of it away.
Excellent for takeout,2023-02-01,4,"Their pizza travels remarkably well. Even after a 20-minute drive home, the crust was still crispy and everything was at the perfect temperature. They have their packaging technique down to a science."
Tasteless cheese substitute,2023-08-02,2,"Their vegan cheese option was terrible - had no meltability, a grainy texture, and tasted strongly of coconut which clashed with the tomato sauce. If you can't do vegan cheese well, better to offer cheese-free options that are properly balanced."
Excessive grease pooling,2023-10-19,2,"Had to continuously blot the pizza with napkins as pools of orange grease formed on top of the cheese with every passing minute. By the end, the napkins were completely saturated and transparent. Felt unhealthy even by pizza standards."

Outstanding wood-fired perfection,2025-05-27,5,The wood-fired oven gives their pizza a distinctive smoky complexity you can't get any other way. The slight char adds bitterness that balances the sweetness of the sauce perfectly. Worth seeking out for this unique flavor profile.
Cold center burnt edges,2023-09-10,2,The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored.
Tomato sauce tasted rancid,2025-06-21,1,"The sauce had a distinctly off flavor that suggested the tomatoes had gone bad before processing. After two bites, couldn't continue eating as the rancid notes became more pronounced. Basic food safety seems questionable."
Perfect NY-style slices,2023-05-26,5,"As a transplant from NYC, I've been searching for authentic NY-style pizza. This place nails it - thin, foldable slices with the right amount of chew and grease. Their plain cheese slice is perfection."

Perfect temperature every time,2023-09-02,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2023-05-05,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."
Not enough cheese,2023-09-12,3,"The sauce and crust were good, but they're stingy with cheese. You could see the sauce through the sparse cheese layer, and what was there didn't have that stretchy pull you want from a good pizza."
Innovative toppings,2025-06-08,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."

Bland sauce needs work,2024-10-18,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
Sauce like ketchup,2023-04-27,2,"The sauce was suspiciously sweet and one-dimensional, reminiscent of ketchup rather than a proper pizza sauce. No evidence of herbs, garlic, or any complexity. Ruined what otherwise could have been a decent pizza."
Creative seasonal specials,2023-05-07,5,"Just had their spring special with asparagus, lemon ricotta, and prosciutto. The combination was bright, fresh, and perfect for the season. Love that they use local, seasonal ingredients."
False advertising on ingredients,2025-01-23,1,"Menu promised 'house-made Italian sausage' but what came on my pizza was clearly pre-formed, uniform pellets of commercial sausage. When questioned, staff admitted they don't make any ingredients in-house despite menu claims."

Undercooked in the middle,2023-11-07,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."

Disappointed with service,2023-04-08,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."

Tough leathery crust,2023-03-08,2,"The crust was so tough I almost couldn't bite through it - like trying to eat leather. The edges were particularly problematic, had to tear pieces off with significant effort. Completely lacks the pleasant chewiness good pizza should have."
Exceptional sauce-making technique,2023-01-30,5,"You can tell their sauce is made with properly hand-crushed tomatoes - it has that perfect texture with small chunks rather than being completely smooth. The bright flavor suggests minimal cooking, allowing the tomato quality to shine."
Greasy and disappointing,2024-09-26,2,"I had high hopes based on the reviews, but my pizza was swimming in grease. The crust was undercooked in the center, and the promised 'fresh vegetables' looked and tasted canned. Such a letdown."
Perfect crust-to-topping ratio,2024-08-27,5,"Some places overload toppings so the crust gets soggy, others are too sparse. This place gets it perfect - enough toppings to get some in every bite, but not so much that the structural integrity is compromised."
Authentic Italian experience,2024-04-19,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."

Too much emphasis on appearance,2023-01-09,3,"The pizza was clearly designed to look good in photos - perfect symmetry, vibrant colors, photogenic cheese pull - but the flavor was underwhelming. Style over substance for the Instagram crowd."
Excellent Chicago deep dish,2023-05-26,5,"Hard to find authentic Chicago-style pizza in this area, but they nail it. The buttery, flaky crust, the layering of cheese under the sauce, the chunky tomato topping - all perfect. Worth the 45-minute cook time."

Applied in dollops after the pizza is mostly baked so it just barely melts while maintaining its creamy integrity. Technical perfection!
Too greasy to enjoy,2023-03-19,2,"Had to literally blot my pizza with napkins, which came away completely saturated with grease. Whatever flavor might have been there was drowned in oil. Couldn't finish it as it was making me feel ill."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2023-02-20,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."

Pizza barely survived the drive home,2023-11-12,2,"Ordered takeout and by the time I got home (15 minutes), the pizza was a soggy mess. They clearly don't use appropriate packaging for takeout - no vents to release steam means the crust steams itself into sogginess."
Too salty,2024-09-30,2,"Everything I tried was oversalted - the crust, the sauce, and especially the cheese. It was like they were trying to ensure you'd order more drinks. Couldn't finish my pizza and was thirsty all night."

Best Hawaiian in the city,2025-01-14,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."

Refrigerated dough taste,2024-01-24,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."
